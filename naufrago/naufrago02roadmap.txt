Naufrago! 0.2 roadmap
---------------------

- Graphical fix: empty space between the main window and the menubar (thanks to Icaria, through GnomeFiles).
- Render fix: strip html and newline tags in entry titles (thanks to Vicente Ruiz, through SourceForge).
- Date parsing entries fix (thanks to Vicente Ruiz, through SourceForge).
- Possible fix in font rendering. Strings converted to utf8 to avoid some PangoWarnings.
- Other fixes to issues it might appear.
- Better conformity with Freedesktop.org (adopted XDG Base Directory Specification, now app folder is located at $HOME/.config/naufrago).
- Option to change Toolbar style and even hide it (accepted feature request from Icaria, through GnomeFiles).
- Option to enable/disable StatusIcon (accepted feature request from Icaria, through GnomeFiles).
- 'Importants' and 'Non read' folders.
- Option to show a notification message when new entries.
- Option to show/hide read entries (accepted feature request from Tom Cowel, through OMG Ubuntu).
- Feed update status indicator through favicon change (accepted feature request from Vicente Ruiz, though SourceForge).
- Term search.
- Translations to Polish (thanks Michał Ćwikliński) and Italian (thanks kir).

There has been a feature request about doing some kind of categorization of the entries marked as Important, but I'm still brainstorming about it's implementation or not, so still in doubt.

I'm seeking guidance and/or help in bug hunting due to issues that I could not spot as long as they don't seem to be associated with a Python exception. A hand with threads in Gtk is also welcome!

PS. I'll be on holidays for some weeks, so if I don't answer, don't get me wrong :)
