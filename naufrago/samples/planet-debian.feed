In a generic sense the answer is of course YES, Xen allows you to run Linux kernels with all the usual range of features and SE Linux isn’t a particularly difficult feature to enable.  I do most of my SE Linux development and testing on virtual machines and until recently I didn’t have any hardware suitable for running KVM, so in the last few years I’ve done more SE Linux testing on Xen than on non-virtual machines.  My <a href="http://www.coker.com.au/selinux/play.html">SE Linux Play Machine [1]</a> (which will be online again tomorrow) is one SE Linux system running under Xen.</p>
<p>But the question was asked in the context of <a href="http://etbe.coker.com.au/2010/06/22/virtual-hosting-prices/">my blog post comparing the prices of virtual hosting providers [2]</a>, which changes things.</p>
<p>Both Linode and Slicehost (the two virtual hosting providers that my clients use) provide kernels without SE Linux support, the command “<b>grep selinux /proc/filesystems</b>” (which is the easiest way to test for SE Linux support) gives no output.  I am not aware of any other virtual hosting company that provides SE Linux support.</p>
<p>If anyone knows of a virtual hosting company that runs Xen or KVM virtual machines with SE Linux support then please let me know, I’ll write a blog post comparing such companies if there are some.</p>
<p><b>For the people who work at ISPs</b>: If your company supports SE Linux virtual machines then I would be happy to review your service, just give me a free DomU for a couple of weeks so I can test it out.  If your company is considering offering such virtual machines then I would be happy to have a confidential discussion about the issues that you will face, while I am available for paid consulting work in this area I am more than happy to spend an hour or two helping a company that’s going to help support my favorite free software project without expecting to be paid.  But I have to note that if a dozen hosting companies happen to want advice I won’t be able to provide two hours of free advice to each of them.</p>
<p>I think that there is an unsatisfied market demand for SE Linux virtual machines.  I don’t expect all virtual hosting companies to support it in the near future, but this will make it more profitable for those that do.  If for the sake of discussion we assume that 5% of sysadmins who are making purchasing decisions regarding virtual servers really want to have SE Linux support and if 5% of virtual hosting companies were to offer such support, then those hosting companies would almost double their market share as a result of supporting SE Linux.  It’s the usual economic factors relating to small companies that profit from providing good support for the needs of a minority of customers.</p>

{'summary_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.debian.org/rss20.xml', 'type': 'text/html', 'value': u'<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/qfunk.png" width="57" height="85" alt="" align="right" />  <p>Funny how life brings those A-HA moments in the least probable of circumstances. Take my career\'s development, for instance. I\'m currently taking a training to become a government bureaucrat. During this training, each student goes through a thorough skill assessment to help the trainer select an appropriate training place in some government office. Asides from covering the obvious aspects of formal education and employment history, we also reviewed achievements and accumulated skills. My A-HA moment came as a result of our trainer asking me to completely rewrite my CV to match some known template. Additionally, she requested that I emphasize my technology background more. I countered by pointing out that the word "technology" tends to mean "engineer" to the average employer and yet I\'ve have always been in Product Management or Business Development, which are more Sales-oriented roles than anything else, hence why I emphasize the Sales aspect and deflate the technology aspect in my CV. Still, while she conceded that difference in emphasis, she insisted that having worked in technology probably influenced my skills or my preferred workflow in one way or another. At the moment, I simply could not think of how it might have.</p>\n\n<p>Boy, was I wrong! Where do I begin?</p>\n\n<p>First of all, it dawned onto me that I simply cannot claim to know Microsoft Office anymore. Until recently, my Open Office skills were easily applicable to Microsoft Office, because Open Office borrowed a lot of concepts from its Microsoft counterpart. However, following the recent redesign of Microsoft Office, I found that I cannot navigate my way around Microsoft Word\'s menus anymore. While this new user interface paradigm indeed removes a lot of clutter, it also hides too many features in less than obvious places, which resulted in me concluding that I simply have to downgrade my Microsoft Office skills to medium. Given the progressive conversion of several Finnish agencies and ministries to Open Office, I\'m not in such an uncomfortable position but, then again, other agencies and ministries fiercely cling on to their Microsoft licenses and have recently upgraded them. As such, should my practical training take place in one of those offices, I would essentially be unable to perform at my job. Redeeming factor: a friend who only knows Microsoft products faced similar frustrations last year when she got back from her summer vacations, after she realized that their network administrator had upgraded her workstation. It took her the whole autumn before she felt comfortable using Word again.</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect of working in Free Software that influences my workflow: telecommuting and teleworking. As anyone working on Free Software projects knows, teams tend to be distributed around the globe, which means that there\'s always someone somewhere pushing a commit or answering bug reports, at any given time of the day. Simultaneously, work quickly becomes location-independent and flexible schedules are the norm; whatever and wherever works for a given developer, as long as the work gets done. Without anyone really noticing, this work methodology has permeated the whole technology ecosystem, even at fortune-500 companies. Employees come in and out of the office at whichever time suits them, while others choose to work from home and only show up whenever face-to-face meetings are called. Others even adopt a nomad lifestyle, constantly roaming the globe for adventures and connecting to the office network via VPN, from the comfort of their hotel room or from a friend\'s couch, on the other side of the globe.</p>\n\n<p>In my case, having twice worked for Estonian companies while living in Finland, it meant taking the ferry twice a week to visit the office. This brought in more benefits than one might initially think: first of all, the quick walk between the metro station and the harbor in Helsinki meant that I arrived on the ferry with blood pumping adrenaline and fully alert. Being on the ferry gave me 2 hours of quiet time to grab my first coffee and plan my day. Getting out of the ferry in Tallinn meant another quick walk, this time between the harbor and the tramway. By the time I arrived at the office, I had exercised twice and planned all my workday. It\'s probably the most productive that I\'ve ever been in my whole career. Additionally, I was frequently on the road, meeting customers and following on sales leads, which meant that I got to close many deals using my laptop in my hotel room. As our CEO used to joke, "I have no idea where in the world Martin-\xc9ric is today but, just as long as the purchase orders keep on pouring in, it\'s all the same to me."</p>\n\n<p>As a result of this reflexion, I had to explain to our trainer why I am extremely well-suited to government jobs that require a lot of traveling and where Free Software is used on the desktop and, vice-versa, extremely unsuited to back-office jobs where whatever Microsoft products of the day are the norm. I\'ve had to put particular emphasis on what Open Office is all about, because many homeworks were supposed to be submitted in Microsoft Word format.

Entry title: Filippo Giunchedi: using git-svn with rsync
Entry link: http://esaurito.net/blog/posts/2010/06/git-svn_and_rsync/
Entry description: <img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/filippo.png" width="65" height="86" alt="" align="right" />  <p>From time to time I find myself using
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html">git-svn</a> with
projects using subversion, this is all nice and fine but it takes quite some
time to do the ''initial import'' if you are doing it over a remote transport
such as <code>ssh+svn</code>.</p>

<p>One trick to speed things up is to use <a href="http://rsync.samba.org">rsync</a> to copy
the svn repo locally and then ''git-svn'' it from your harddisk. The idea is
originally documented at the <a href="http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Git-SVN#Converting_the_repository">allegro
wiki</a></p>

<p>For example a typical <a href="http://sf.net">sourceforge</a> project will be done like
this:</p>

<pre class="hl">DESTDIR<span class="hl sym">=/</span>your<span class="hl sym">/</span>dest
PROJECTNAME<span class="hl sym">=</span>vde
PROJECTURL<span class="hl sym">=</span>https<span class="hl sym">://</span><span class="hl kwb">$PROJECTNAME</span>.svn.sourceforge.net<span class="hl sym">/</span>svnroot<span class="hl sym">/</span><span class="hl kwb">$PROJECTNAME</span>
SVN_COPY<span class="hl sym">=</span>$<span class="hl sym">(</span>mktemp <span class="hl sym">-</span>d<span class="hl sym">)</span>
rsync <span class="hl sym">-</span>c <span class="hl sym">-</span>av <span class="hl kwb">$PROJECTNAME</span>.svn.sourceforge.net<span class="hl sym">::</span>svn<span class="hl sym">/</span><span class="hl kwb">$PROJECTNAME</span><span class="hl sym">/</span><span class="hl str">'*'</span> <span class="hl kwb">$SVN_COPY</span>
mkdir <span class="hl sym">-</span>p <span class="hl kwb">$DESTDIR</span>
<span class="hl kwb">cd $DESTDIR</span>
git svn init <span class="hl kwc">file</span><span class="hl sym">://</span><span class="hl kwb">$SVN_COPY</span> <span class="hl sym">--</span>rewrite<span class="hl sym">-</span>root<span class="hl sym">=</span><span class="hl kwb">$PROJECTURL</span> <span class="hl sym">--</span>stdlayout
git svn fetch
<span class="hl slc"># ... git svn imports the repo ...</span>
<span class="hl kwc">sed</span> <span class="hl sym">-</span>i <span class="hl str">'s@url =.*@url = $PROJECTURL'</span> .git<span class="hl sym">/</span>config
<span class="hl kwc">rm</span> <span class="hl sym">-</span>rf <span class="hl kwb">$SVN_COPY</span>
</pre>

<p>The important bit is to remember to update the <code>url</code> key after
updating otherwise subsequent commits will go to your rsync-ed repo and not the
original one!</p>

<p>I did notice one problem with it I have not had time to report to
the BTS yet.  There is no .desktop file in the package, so the tool do
not show up in the Gnome and KDE menus, but only deep down in in the
Debian submenu in KDE.  I hope that can be fixed before Squeeze is
released.</p>

<p>I have not yet been able to get it to modify the tree yet.  I would
like to move objects and remove subtrees directly in the GUI, but have
not found a way to do that with LUMA yet.  So in the mean time, I use
<a href="http://www.lichteblau.com/ldapvi/">ldapvi</a> for that.</p>

<p>If you have tips on other GUI tools for LDAP that might be useful
in Debian Edu, please contact us on debian-edu@lists.debian.org.</p>

<p>Update 2010-06-29: Ross Reedstrom tipped us about the
<a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/g/gq.html">gq</a> package as a
useful GUI alternative.  It seem like a good tool, but is unmaintained
in Debian and got a RC bug keeping it out of Squeeze.  Unless that
changes, it will not be an option for Debian Edu based on Squeeze.</p>

Both FF/IW and Chrome can do the label thing, where you bookmark something like \u201chttp://bugs.debian.org/%s\u201d with a shortcut like \u201cbugs\u201d and can then simply Ctrl-L to the address bar and type \u201cbugs 999999\u2033. Done.<br />\nCan the way Epiphany does this be more effective? (actually this is the way Galeon did it way back then and I used to love it before I found out I could be way quicker with the keyboard+shortcut thingy. Not to mention having less clutter in the toolbar.)</p>\n<p>And granted: <del datetime="2010-06-27T13:28:59+00:00">Chromium\u2019s interface doesn\u2019t allow the editing of this shortcut and they only work when imported from FF/IW, but I expect this to be fixed eventually. Doesn\u2019t make much sense to have such a \u201chidden\u201d feature.</del> [<strong>UPDATE</strong>: nevermind.

I bought it almost two years ago, when the local phone provider LMT started offering the iPhone legally. I had a pretty good experience with it most of the time, but now it is showing its age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The two year warranty will run out in September</li>\n<li>The iOS 4 update left out most of the new features \u2013 my model cann\u2019t have multitasking or backgrounds or any of that new cool stuff that is exclusive to the new iPhone 4</li>\n<li>The hardware itself is starting to wear \u2013 the speaker stopped working a few weeks ago (so I have to use the loudspeaker function or headphones) and also approximately around that time the phone stated to randomly lock up approximately one a week or two \u2013 it freezes and after a few minutes reboots and demads to be connected to iTunes and restored from backup</li>\n<li>Also the battery does not last as long as it used to</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will try to send my iPhone in for repair hoping to extend its usefulness, but frankly it looks that I might have to get a new phone at or before Debconf.</p>\n<p>So I am considering my options for a new phone and so far I have 3 main options each with some sub-options. The main options are: iPhone 4, MeeGo and Android. Each choice has its benefits and drawbacks and each also has several sub-options related either to specific phone models or to purchase methods.</p>\n<p>What I need is a phone with: calling function, contact information synchronised to Google, support for Google Mail/Contacts/Calendar simultaneously with one Exchange account also providing mail/contacts/calendars, music, audiobooks \u2013 saving my place in the audio book and in the list of books, fully featured Twitter client with Twitpic and location support, encrypted password storage application (preferably open source), GPS with maps, ability to download maps for offline use, Geocaching support with offline cache info and logging, Skype client, ability to write in Latvian, English and Russian in all applications, reliable backup and restore of phones data including settings and data of installed apps. <em>Optional features:</em> last.fm streaming and reporting support, ebook applications with purchasable ebooks, high quality video and photo recording (for a phone), ability for me to write applications on the phone, ssh client, wireless data upload to the phone, ability to change the phones battery without loosing data in the phone (on the go), compass, physical keyboard, confidence in getting software upgrades and developer interest for the next 2 years.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll try to describe all of the options here to organise my thoughts and maybe also help someone else make the choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Option 1: iPhone 4</strong></p>\n<p>To get the iPhone 4 I have two options: LMT and unlocked. </p>\n<p>The official arrival of iPhone 4 to Latvia is expected in September and it will likely be sold by LMT for the same prices as iPhone 3GS is now. If I choose this scenario, I will need to survive with my semi-broken iPhone for 2-3 more months. Total price over 2 years (LVL): 131 (purchase price) + 24 * 8 (surcharge) = 323 LVL.</p>\n<p>Note: the surcharge is the extra cost of the iPhone call plan compared to a comparable regular plan (Vien\u0101dais 7 + Internets telefon\u0101 5).</p>\n<p>If I go and purchase an unlocked iPhone 4 in a country where such units are sold (UK is the most easily accessible choice, because a few of my workmates travel weekly to and from UK) then the total price over 2 years would be the purchase price: 499 GBP + 65 GBP (2 year warranty extension) = 505 LVL</p>\n<p>Now lets go over the general benefits and downsides of the iPhone 4, first the positives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is a simple to use device that I am used to over the two years</li>\n<li>The screen resolution is higher than any other option</li>\n<li>It is smaller and lighter than Nokia N900 and the bigger Android devices</li>\n<li>There is a huge number of free and paid apps as well as accessories for the iPhone \u2013 docks, headphones, chargers, \u2026</li>\n<li>I know that it can do every thing that I need it to do (with apps) and most of the optional features too, except \u2026 (see drawbacks)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first thing that I hate about the iPhone is its umbilical cord like link to iTunes. iTunes is the sole purpose I still have a real Windows installation on my main computer (in a Sun VirtualBox, thankfully). iTunes is slow, clumsy and generally unusable piece of dog excrements. It can only do one thing at a time, mostly: if you are adding a folder to your library, you can\u2019t switch to another tab and see how the backup of your iPhone is going. The actions do happen in the background, but more often than not you cann\u2019t switch away from some actions. If you try to do multiple things in parallel, instead of resolving any process conflicts and queueing the actions iTunes will simply silently fails to do something, often leaving remains of the half-finished actions. It also does not bother to check if the backup or restore of the phone is complete before using it \u2013 in this way I have many time gotten into a situation where I connect the iPhone to the iTunes, it starts backing it up, then crashes and next time happily offers this half-done backup copy as a valid restore point. Or it crashes during restore and only writes some files and settings to the phone \u2013 other settings stay at their default values. It is also very cryptic, for example if you have a lot of music it can take hours to import it into iTunes (it spent 2 hours \u2018Analysing gapless playback information\u2019 of 5000 songs) and then you will be puzzled about how to put some of that on the iPhone. If you just tick the checkbox to sync your music you\u2019ll get an error stating that there is not enough free space, which is not very helpful. The magic combination was to check \u2018Manually manage music\u2019 and then go to music tab and choose \u2018Autofill\u2019 option. At that point iTunes will spend half an hour choosing which songs to put on the phone, before it even starts copying. And god forbid that you would use that AppStore application on the iPhone to actually install apps \u2013 sooner or later you will run into a \u2018backup bug\u2019 where creating or restoring a backup of your iPhone might take 2-3 hours instead of more normal 5-15 minutes. Only a factory reset of the phone followed by selective reinstallation of applications (loosing all their settings in the process) can work around this bug currently.</li>\n<li>The closed nature of the iPhone means that I cann\u2019t install \u2018unapproved\u2019 software unless I jailbreak the phone and even then it is rather problematic to develop for the phone unless you have a Mac and shell out 99$ a year for participation in the developers program</li>\n<li>The iPhone is a consumption device and not a productivity device. I would like to have a device on which I could be creative as a software developer as well</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option 2: Maemo/MeeGo</strong></p>\n<p>Some of my colleagues at work (in the Riga office of Accenture) have N900 phones and I have been exposed to people with raw enthusiasm towards the Maemo platform ever since the Debconf in Helsinki, where we saw the first N700 devices in the hands of some lucky Debian/Nokia people using it as an Internet tablet. N900 has been a strong leap forward for the platform, before its head was teleported sideways by the whole MeeGo merger/debackle.</p>\n<p>Again I have two options here:</p>\n<p>Get a N900 either here in Latvia for 325 LVL (that would be the total cost over 2 years) or get it from USA during Debconf for 399 USD (+129 USD for 2 year warranty) = 317 LVL. And additional option would be to wait until October/November and then buy the new Nokia MeeGo device, rumoured to be N9-00 and likely to be around the same price as N900 was when it was introduced (around 500 LVL).</p>\n<p>Benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A fully open and rooted Debian Linux based device with apt-get, X, pusleaudio, d-bus and Qt as core technologies</li>\n<li>I can install software from anyone and can also write my own software either in Qt/C++ or even in Python</li>\n<li>There is a significant hacker community that develops applications for N900</li>\n<li>As far as I know most of the features that I need do work on N900, but I am unsure about:\n<ol>\n<li>audiobook support \u2013 how easy it is to put a MP3 on the device and tell it is an audiobbok so that the device would remember position when playing the file and save it even if the player is stopped and the device is rebooted or backed up and restored from backup?</li>\n<li>can I have Google Mail, Contacts and Calendar and at the same time also have an Exchange account with mail and contacts and calendar active?</li>\n<li>how is the Geocaching.com support \u2013 is there an app already that makes it easy to geocache while offline?</li>\n<li>Multilingual keyboards \u2013 I\u2019ve seen people having to reimplement the on-screen keyboard in their programs, and naturally they do not bother to add support for all language. So support for multilingual keyboard input is an open one.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All the uncertainties above \u2013 while I could write all the above software, it would be better if I would not have to, so that I could focus on something more productive</li>\n<li>Also the whole position of Nokia on the MeeGo support on the N900 is kinda \u2026 backwards. I am now used to the Apple way that if I get a device, then it will get software updates for at least next two years and will get the new software features developed in the next two years at least. If Nokia would have said \u2013 \u201cAll phone-oriented MeeGo releases will have a version for N900 until at least the end of 2012.\u201d Then this drawback would not have been there, but currently it is a mayor sticking stone for me. I don\u2019t want to buy a device that will be on a dead-end software platform that will die before the end of this year.</li>\n<li>N900 is the largest and heaviest of all the options</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option 3 \u2013 Android</strong></p>\n<p>After looking trough the options for Android phones, I\u2019ve narrowed the selection to the ones that are either available from local carriers or can be easily gotten unlocked also the phones need to have announced plans to have at least Android 2.2 version. Currently the choice is limited to HTC Desire (from carrier or unlocked) and Samsung Galaxy S (unlocked). The prices over 2 years break down as follows:</p>\n<p>HTC Desire (locked to LMT): 69 + 9*24 = 285 LVL<br />\nHTC Desire (locked to Bite): 199 + 2*24 = 247 LVL (Note: only 500Mb of data per month available)<br />\nHTC Desire (locked to Tele2): 179 + 6*24 = 323 LVL<br />\nNote: all the above options would also require me to pay a 45 LVL early termination fee on my current iPhone contract if I choose to do this before September.<br />\nHTC Desire (unlocked): <strong>311 LVL</strong><br />\nSamsung Galaxy S (unlocked): 350 LVL (import from Germany)</p>\n<p>Benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As far as I could find, the features I need are out there in one way or another \u2013 there usually is an app for that!</li>\n<li>Google looks poised to continue development at a rapid pace</li>\n<li>There is an active hacker community and also an active commercial software community that offers cool applications for a few bucks</li>\n<li>As far as I understand the phone backups onto itself \u2013 a backup of the phone is created onto a SD card in the phone and you can then copy that off the phone for permanent backup, it is a nice concept</li>\n<li>There are literally thousands of sources for Android applications: from the official Market to Google Code to individual web pages and forums</li>\n<li>The hardware looks solid, powerful and generic enough to last for a couple of years</li>\n<li>It is likely that knowing how to program Android app will be useful for me at work</li>\n<li>It is cheap and simple to start writing Android apps on Linux</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Typical usability of Android apps is pretty low compared to iPhone</li>\n<li>The Android environment is very unique and is not like anything else \u2013 it\u2019s not really much of a Linux system from an apps perspective</li>\n<li>I would be relying on HTC to provide OS updates in a timely manner \u2013 it is quite likely that after a year or so the updates to new version will come slowly or even stop altogether and I will have to use hacked ROMs</li>\n<li>I have a dislike for Java. I wish one could write fully featured Android apps in Python <img src="http://www.aigarius.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please correct me if I am wrong with something!!!</strong> And also it would be cool if you expressed your own opinions in the comments.</p>\n<p>Currently I am very undecided about what I am going to do, but after completing this entry I am leaning towards an unlocked HTC Desire.</p>\n<p>Update:<br />\n<a href="http://www.tester.ca/2010/06/26/n900-vs-nexus-one-a-comparison/">Olivier Cr\xeate shares a N900 vs. Nexus One experience</a></p>', 'language': None}, 'updated_parsed': (2010, 6, 27, 11, 47, 32, 6, 178, 0), 'links': [{'href': u'http://www.aigarius.com/blog/2010/06/26/phoning-it-in/', 'type': 'text/html', 'rel': 'alternate'}], 'title': u'Aigars Mahinovs: Phoning it in', 'updated': u'Sun, 27 Jun 2010 11:47:32 +0000', 'summary': u'<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/aigarius_hg.png" width="85" height="116" alt="" align="right" />  <p>Currently I own and use an iPhone 3G.

It can only do one thing at a time, mostly: if you are adding a folder to your library, you can\u2019t switch to another tab and see how the backup of your iPhone is going. The actions do happen in the background, but more often than not you cann\u2019t switch away from some actions. If you try to do multiple things in parallel, instead of resolving any process conflicts and queueing the actions iTunes will simply silently fails to do something, often leaving remains of the half-finished actions. It also does not bother to check if the backup or restore of the phone is complete before using it \u2013 in this way I have many time gotten into a situation where I connect the iPhone to the iTunes, it starts backing it up, then crashes and next time happily offers this half-done backup copy as a valid restore point. Or it crashes during restore and only writes some files and settings to the phone \u2013 other settings stay at their default values. It is also very cryptic, for example if you have a lot of music it can take hours to import it into iTunes (it spent 2 hours \u2018Analysing gapless playback information\u2019 of 5000 songs) and then you will be puzzled about how to put some of that on the iPhone. If you just tick the checkbox to sync your music you\u2019ll get an error stating that there is not enough free space, which is not very helpful. The magic combination was to check \u2018Manually manage music\u2019 and then go to music tab and choose \u2018Autofill\u2019 option. At that point iTunes will spend half an hour choosing which songs to put on the phone, before it even starts copying. And god forbid that you would use that AppStore application on the iPhone to actually install apps \u2013 sooner or later you will run into a \u2018backup bug\u2019 where creating or restoring a backup of your iPhone might take 2-3 hours instead of more normal 5-15 minutes. Only a factory reset of the phone followed by selective reinstallation of applications (loosing all their settings in the process) can work around this bug currently.</li>\n<li>The closed nature of the iPhone means that I cann\u2019t install \u2018unapproved\u2019 software unless I jailbreak the phone and even then it is rather problematic to develop for the phone unless you have a Mac and shell out 99$ a year for participation in the developers program</li>\n<li>The iPhone is a consumption device and not a productivity device.

Entry title: Aigars Mahinovs: Phoning it in
Entry link: http://www.aigarius.com/blog/2010/06/26/phoning-it-in/
Entry description: <img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/aigarius_hg.png" width="85" height="116" alt="" align="right" />  <p>Currently I own and use an iPhone 3G. I bought it almost two years ago, when the local phone provider LMT started offering the iPhone legally. I had a pretty good experience with it most of the time, but now it is showing its age:</p>
<ul>
<li>The two year warranty will run out in September</li>
<li>The iOS 4 update left out most of the new features – my model cann’t have multitasking or backgrounds or any of that new cool stuff that is exclusive to the new iPhone 4</li>
<li>The hardware itself is starting to wear – the speaker stopped working a few weeks ago (so I have to use the loudspeaker function or headphones) and also approximately around that time the phone stated to randomly lock up approximately one a week or two – it freezes and after a few minutes reboots and demads to be connected to iTunes and restored from backup</li>
<li>Also the battery does not last as long as it used to</li>
</ul>
<p>I will try to send my iPhone in for repair hoping to extend its usefulness, but frankly it looks that I might have to get a new phone at or before Debconf.</p>
<p>So I am considering my options for a new phone and so far I have 3 main options each with some sub-options. The main options are: iPhone 4, MeeGo and Android. Each choice has its benefits and drawbacks and each also has several sub-options related either to specific phone models or to purchase methods.</p>
<p>What I need is a phone with: calling function, contact information synchronised to Google, support for Google Mail/Contacts/Calendar simultaneously with one Exchange account also providing mail/contacts/calendars, music, audiobooks – saving my place in the audio book and in the list of books, fully featured Twitter client with Twitpic and location support, encrypted password storage application (preferably open source), GPS with maps, ability to download maps for offline use, Geocaching support with offline cache info and logging, Skype client, ability to write in Latvian, English and Russian in all applications, reliable backup and restore of phones data including settings and data of installed apps. <em>Optional features:</em> last.fm streaming and reporting support, ebook applications with purchasable ebooks, high quality video and photo recording (for a phone), ability for me to write applications on the phone, ssh client, wireless data upload to the phone, ability to change the phones battery without loosing data in the phone (on the go), compass, physical keyboard, confidence in getting software upgrades and developer interest for the next 2 years.</p>
<p>I’ll try to describe all of the options here to organise my thoughts and maybe also help someone else make the choice.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: iPhone 4</strong></p>
<p>To get the iPhone 4 I have two options: LMT and unlocked. </p>
<p>The official arrival of iPhone 4 to Latvia is expected in September and it will likely be sold by LMT for the same prices as iPhone 3GS is now. If I choose this scenario, I will need to survive with my semi-broken iPhone for 2-3 more months. Total price over 2 years (LVL): 131 (purchase price) + 24 * 8 (surcharge) = 323 LVL.</p>
<p>Note: the surcharge is the extra cost of the iPhone call plan compared to a comparable regular plan (Vienādais 7 + Internets telefonā 5).</p>
<p>If I go and purchase an unlocked iPhone 4 in a country where such units are sold (UK is the most easily accessible choice, because a few of my workmates travel weekly to and from UK) then the total price over 2 years would be the purchase price: 499 GBP + 65 GBP (2 year warranty extension) = 505 LVL</p>
<p>Now lets go over the general benefits and downsides of the iPhone 4, first the positives:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a simple to use device that I am used to over the two years</li>
<li>The screen resolution is higher than any other option</li>
<li>It is smaller and lighter than Nokia N900 and the bigger Android devices</li>
<li>There is a huge number of free and paid apps as well as accessories for the iPhone – docks, headphones, chargers, …</li>
<li>I know that it can do every thing that I need it to do (with apps) and most of the optional features too, except … (see drawbacks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing that I hate about the iPhone is its umbilical cord like link to iTunes. iTunes is the sole purpose I still have a real Windows installation on my main computer (in a Sun VirtualBox, thankfully). iTunes is slow, clumsy and generally unusable piece of dog excrements. It can only do one thing at a time, mostly: if you are adding a folder to your library, you can’t switch to another tab and see how the backup of your iPhone is going. The actions do happen in the background, but more often than not you cann’t switch away from some actions. If you try to do multiple things in parallel, instead of resolving any process conflicts and queueing the actions iTunes will simply silently fails to do something, often leaving remains of the half-finished actions. It also does not bother to check if the backup or restore of the phone is complete before using it – in this way I have many time gotten into a situation where I connect the iPhone to the iTunes, it starts backing it up, then crashes and next time happily offers this half-done backup copy as a valid restore point. Or it crashes during restore and only writes some files and settings to the phone – other settings stay at their default values. It is also very cryptic, for example if you have a lot of music it can take hours to import it into iTunes (it spent 2 hours ‘Analysing gapless playback information’ of 5000 songs) and then you will be puzzled about how to put some of that on the iPhone.

<li>The closed nature of the iPhone means that I cann’t install ‘unapproved’ software unless I jailbreak the phone and even then it is rather problematic to develop for the phone unless you have a Mac and shell out 99$ a year for participation in the developers program</li>
<li>The iPhone is a consumption device and not a productivity device. I would like to have a device on which I could be creative as a software developer as well</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option 2: Maemo/MeeGo</strong></p>
<p>Some of my colleagues at work (in the Riga office of Accenture) have N900 phones and I have been exposed to people with raw enthusiasm towards the Maemo platform ever since the Debconf in Helsinki, where we saw the first N700 devices in the hands of some lucky Debian/Nokia people using it as an Internet tablet.

And additional option would be to wait until October/November and then buy the new Nokia MeeGo device, rumoured to be N9-00 and likely to be around the same price as N900 was when it was introduced (around 500 LVL).</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully open and rooted Debian Linux based device with apt-get, X, pusleaudio, d-bus and Qt as core technologies</li>
<li>I can install software from anyone and can also write my own software either in Qt/C++ or even in Python</li>
<li>There is a significant hacker community that develops applications for N900</li>
<li>As far as I know most of the features that I need do work on N900, but I am unsure about:
<ol>
<li>audiobook support – how easy it is to put a MP3 on the device and tell it is an audiobbok so that the device would remember position when playing the file and save it even if the player is stopped and the device is rebooted or backed up and restored from backup?</li>
<li>can I have Google Mail, Contacts and Calendar and at the same time also have an Exchange account with mail and contacts and calendar active?</li>
<li>how is the Geocaching.com support – is there an app already that makes it easy to geocache while offline?</li>
<li>Multilingual keyboards – I’ve seen people having to reimplement the on-screen keyboard in their programs, and naturally they do not bother to add support for all language. So support for multilingual keyboard input is an open one.</li>
</ol>
</li>

I don’t want to buy a device that will be on a dead-end software platform that will die before the end of this year.</li>
<li>N900 is the largest and heaviest of all the options</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option 3 – Android</strong></p>
<p>After looking trough the options for Android phones, I’ve narrowed the selection to the ones that are either available from local carriers or can be easily gotten unlocked also the phones need to have announced plans to have at least Android 2.2 version. Currently the choice is limited to HTC Desire (from carrier or unlocked) and Samsung Galaxy S (unlocked). The prices over 2 years break down as follows:</p>
<p>HTC Desire (locked to LMT): 69 + 9*24 = 285 LVL<br />
HTC Desire (locked to Bite): 199 + 2*24 = 247 LVL (Note: only 500Mb of data per month available)<br />
HTC Desire (locked to Tele2): 179 + 6*24 = 323 LVL<br />
Note: all the above options would also require me to pay a 45 LVL early termination fee on my current iPhone contract if I choose to do this before September.<br />
HTC Desire (unlocked): <strong>311 LVL</strong><br />
Samsung Galaxy S (unlocked): 350 LVL (import from Germany)</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>As far as I could find, the features I need are out there in one way or another – there usually is an app for that!</li>
<li>Google looks poised to continue development at a rapid pace</li>
<li>There is an active hacker community and also an active commercial software community that offers cool applications for a few bucks</li>
<li>As far as I understand the phone backups onto itself – a backup of the phone is created onto a SD card in the phone and you can then copy that off the phone for permanent backup, it is a nice concept</li>
<li>There are literally thousands of sources for Android applications: from the official Market to Google Code to individual web pages and forums</li>
<li>The hardware looks solid, powerful and generic enough to last for a couple of years</li>
<li>It is likely that knowing how to program Android app will be useful for me at work</li>
<li>It is cheap and simple to start writing Android apps on Linux</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typical usability of Android apps is pretty low compared to iPhone</li>
<li>The Android environment is very unique and is not like anything else – it’s not really much of a Linux system from an apps perspective</li>
<li>I would be relying on HTC to provide OS updates in a timely manner – it is quite likely that after a year or so the updates to new version will come slowly or even stop altogether and I will have to use hacked ROMs</li>
<li>I have a dislike for Java. I wish one could write fully featured Android apps in Python <img src="http://www.aigarius.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please correct me if I am wrong with something!!!</strong> And also it would be cool if you expressed your own opinions in the comments.</p>
<p>Currently I am very undecided about what I am going to do, but after completing this entry I am leaning towards an unlocked HTC Desire.</p>

Entry description: <img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/christine.png" width="100" height="100" alt="" align="right" />  <p>Inspired by various Planet Debian postings, I've spent some time
recently looking into a few RC bugs to help with the Squeeze release.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=581227">mpg123-el #581227</a></strong> A
previous commenter on this bug suggested a proposed fix, which I tested
and uploaded. I think the bug's severity was inflated to begin with, so
I downgraded the bug as well.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=580246">doclifter #580246</a></strong> This
one had to do with the python2.6 transition. I
pointed out a patch against Ubuntu's version of the package that fixes
this problem, and someone else made an NMU based on that. (Seemed like a
good idea to look in the PTS for Ubuntu patches since Ubuntu always
transitions to newer Python before Debian proper.)</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=580110">gnuvd #580110</a></strong> I
checked upstream and a new version that's supposed to fix this bug was
released <em>today</em>, so I updated the bug report to make note of this and
give the maintainer a chance to look at it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583820">libtommath #583820</a></strong> This
FTBFS bug was caused by a previous NMU that fixed a different FTBFS and
also made some unrelated changes. I sent a message to the previous NMUer
noting this fact and made a new upload fixing the new FTBFS.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=580820">fceu #580820</a></strong> Needs

So, I have two radios, one with a broken receive circuit.  What to do?</p>\n<p>GIVE THEM TO JACOB!  I explained that one radio is the \u201ctalking\u201d radio (the broken one) and the other is the \u201clistening\u201d radio.  Then I demonstrated how I could use the talking radio and he could hear me on the listening radio.  That was great fun.  I encouraged him to go to the kitchen and see if he could still hear me in the next room.  Cackles of laughter gave me the answer.  Then he discovered the \u201ccall\u201d button would make the other radio sound like a telephone, which was all the more exciting.  He and I took turns with the talking and listening radios.</p>\n<p>Then I used the belt clip and attached the listening radio to the back of his shirt.  I pointed out to him that this was sort of like a loudspeaker.  Anything he said into the talking radio while holding town the transmit button would sound louder because it would also come out the radio on his back.  Much cackling followed, and he ran around the house yelling \u201cMEOW!\u201d at the top of his lungs into the radio, then saying, \u201cDad, did you hear THAT?  It was VERY loud!\u201d  He has spent hours listening to himself, listening to me, and generally enjoying life with radios.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgoerzen/4736563378/" title="IMG_4218.JPG by prairiecode, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4736563378_1d4cf17b50.jpg" alt="IMG_4218.JPG" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>\n<p>Jacob\u2019s second discovery was a cassette tape player.  Awhile back, Terah rescued an old cassette tape player that was being thrown out, and bought a few 15-cent tapes for Jacob at a thrift store.  The idea is that we can just let him play, and not care if he smashes it to bits.  He enjoys it, but like the computer, didn\u2019t really get excited about it.  Until yesterday, when we had this conversation:</p>\n<p>Me: \u201cJacob, would you like to record your own voice on a tape?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jacob: (excited) \u201cSure!\u201d</p>\n<p>Me: \u201cOK, bring me your tape recorder.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jacob: (exasperated) \u201cDad, it\u2019s not a tape RECORDER.

That is silly!\u201d  (scampers off to find it)</p>\n<p>He found it, and I helped him put some tape over the write-protect tab on a cassette he had.  Then he recorded his voice.  He eventually figured out the stop, rewind, play, and record buttons with my help.  But he\u2019s still confused: while he\u2019s recording, why doesn\u2019t he hear anything?  Our first recording had me asking him some questions, and then telling him to press the stop button when he was done.  He listened to it dozens of times, and each time my recorded voice asked a question, he answered it a little before his recorded voice did.  And each time my recorded voice told him to press the stop button, he would say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d while his recorded voice asked \u201cis this it?\u201d  He pretty well understands what the radios are about, but doesn\u2019t really \u201cget\u201d the tape recorder yet.  Nevertheless, it has just become a far more exciting device in his eyes.</p>\n<p>Terah has been rolling her eyes at me today as I\u2019ve been trying to think up what other broken or old bits of technology we might have that Jacob would enjoy.  My latest plan involves adapting his broken old batte<br />\nry-operated fan into some sort of lego-related car.  I think he\u2019d have fun working on it with me too.</p>\n<p>All this reminds me of things I did as a kid.  My dad worked with a semi-retired man (Herb Miller) that loved to build weird contraptions.  One of my favorites was a ball shooter made out of an old vacuum cleaner with a cardboard tube attached to the output spot.  I also remember building a motorized car out of an erector set that sort of bent the rules at a school science class project.  The idea was to launch a vehicle down a ramp and person whose vehicle went the farthest got a prize.  There were no rules against using batteries and a scavenged motor to get that extra little edge over gravity.  My car was the only one to manage to crash into the wall on the far side of the gymnasium.  The science teacher, in a bit of fast thinking perhaps, announced my car the winner of the \u201celectric division.\u201d  For some reason, I seem to be poised to encourage this sort of thinking in Jacob\u2026</p>', 'language': None}, 'updated_parsed': (2010, 6, 26, 19, 51, 1, 5, 177, 0), 'links': [{'href': u'http://changelog.complete.org/archives/1507-perfect-use-for-broken-technology-give-it-to-a-3-year-old', 'type': 'text/html', 'rel': 'alternate'}], 'title': u'John Goerzen: Perfect use for broken technology: Give it to a 3-year-old', 'updated': u'Sat, 26 Jun 2010 19:51:01 +0000', 'summary': u'<p>I last wrote about Jacob\u2019s <a href="http://changelog.complete.org/archives/1451-jacob-has-a-new-computer-and-a-favorite-shell">new computer</a> back in April.

Entry description: <p>I last wrote about Jacob’s <a href="http://changelog.complete.org/archives/1451-jacob-has-a-new-computer-and-a-favorite-shell">new computer</a> back in April.  He has had fun with it, but is still a little young to appreciate it a whole lot.  It’s a fun thing, but not yet a favorite.</p>
<p>Yesterday, though, I introduced Jacob to several bits of technology that really got him excited.</p>
<p>We have a pair of FRS radios.  These are low-power “Family Radio Service” devices, with a maximum practical range of maybe a mile, and are about as cheap a radio as you can buy that still has any sort of practical use.  Anyhow, the receive circuit on one broke.  I ordered a pair of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WY8JRU?ie=UTF8&tag=thechan08-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000WY8JRU">TriSquare digital radios</a> to replace them, which are incompatible.  So, I have two radios, one with a broken receive circuit.  What to do?</p>
<p>GIVE THEM TO JACOB!  I explained that one radio is the “talking” radio (the broken one) and the other is the “listening” radio.  Then I demonstrated how I could use the talking radio and he could hear me on the listening radio.  That was great fun.  I encouraged him to go to the kitchen and see if he could still hear me in the next room.  Cackles of laughter gave me the answer.  Then he discovered the “call” button would make the other radio sound like a telephone, which was all the more exciting.  He and I took turns with the talking and listening radios.</p>
<p>Then I used the belt clip and attached the listening radio to the back of his shirt.  I pointed out to him that this was sort of like a loudspeaker.  Anything he said into the talking radio while holding town the transmit button would sound louder because it would also come out the radio on his back.  Much cackling followed, and he ran around the house yelling “MEOW!” at the top of his lungs into the radio, then saying, “Dad, did you hear THAT?  It was VERY loud!”  He has spent hours listening to himself, listening to me, and generally enjoying life with radios.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgoerzen/4736563378/" title="IMG_4218.JPG by prairiecode, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4736563378_1d4cf17b50.jpg" alt="IMG_4218.JPG" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Jacob’s second discovery was a cassette tape player.  Awhile back, Terah rescued an old cassette tape player that was being thrown out, and bought a few 15-cent tapes for Jacob at a thrift store.  The idea is that we can just let him play, and not care if he smashes it to bits.  He enjoys it, but like the computer, didn’t really get excited about it.  Until yesterday, when we had this conversation:</p>
<p>Me: “Jacob, would you like to record your own voice on a tape?”</p>
<p>Jacob: (excited) “Sure!”</p>
<p>Me: “OK, bring me your tape recorder.”</p>
<p>Jacob: (exasperated) “Dad, it’s not a tape RECORDER.  It’s a tape PLAYER.”</p>
<p>Me: “Jacob, it is a tape player, but it’s also a tape recorder too.”</p>
<p>Jacob: (paused for about 5 seconds, then…) “Ooooo!  That is silly!”  (scampers off to find it)</p>
<p>He found it, and I helped him put some tape over the write-protect tab on a cassette he had.  Then he recorded his voice.  He eventually figured out the stop, rewind, play, and record buttons with my help.  But he’s still confused: while he’s recording, why doesn’t he hear anything?  Our first recording had me asking him some questions, and then telling him to press the stop button when he was done.  He listened to it dozens of times, and each time my recorded voice asked a question, he answered it a little before his recorded voice did.  And each time my recorded voice told him to press the stop button, he would say, “I don’t want to” while his recorded voice asked “is this it?”  He pretty well understands what the radios are about, but doesn’t really “get” the tape recorder yet.  Nevertheless, it has just become a far more exciting device in his eyes.</p>
<p>Terah has been rolling her eyes at me today as I’ve been trying to think up what other broken or old bits of technology we might have that Jacob would enjoy.  My latest plan involves adapting his broken old batte<br />
ry-operated fan into some sort of lego-related car.  I think he’d have fun working on it with me too.</p>
<p>All this reminds me of things I did as a kid.  My dad worked with a semi-retired man (Herb Miller) that loved to build weird contraptions.

<p>
At lunch most of the office was together at the pub, celebrating a
software release.  I had an entertaining discussion with the Technical
Director about how our next major version should be developed - we
disagree.  But it seems I've convinced several key people of the
merits of basing our work on <a href="http://www.debian.org/">a

<p>
Stepping back a moment, I'm quite pleased with the changes I've been
able to make since joining the company ten months ago.  There's always
more to be done, of course - but it's satisfying to make a difference.

Entry description: <p>Hi again! Sorry for the non-existent post of last week, but I didn't really
have anything exciting to say.
The project is still alive, and I'm still making (rather slow) progress.</p>

<p>Since the last report, I've been reading, cleaning, and fixing the drivers for
the Smedia Glamo (the multi-function device that does µSD card access,
display handling, and coffee), in order to submit them upstream and eventually
backport them in Debian.
Hopefully it'll soon be suitable for upstream and I'll be back to d-i itself!</p>

<p>By the way, the git repositories are updated with a cleaner patchset and with framebuffer support!</p>

Entry description: <p>
Oddly, I have had four different people ask me about the best way to begin a <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> project or setup their system to make it easy to develop with Django.
</p>
<p>
Since I've now given my response via email so many times, I figure I might as well broadcast it and hopefully this will help others as well
</p>
<p>
My assumptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Linux (or a Unix machine)</li>
<li>Single developer with root access (quite possibly a laptop)</li>
<li>Knowledge of DVCSes (e.g. git / hg / bzr )</li>
</ul>
<p>
What we will do is create a private binary directory and another <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> modules. Then take a checkout of the two most important Django projects, and make them work.
</p>
<p>
First: create your user
</p>
<pre>$ sudo adduser newbie
$ ssh localhost -l newbie
$ whoami
newbie
</pre>
<p>
Then we want to create some local bin and lib directories. First the binary directory
</p>
<p>
<code>$ mkdir ~/bin </code># On <a href="http://www.ubuntu.org/">Ubuntu</a>/<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, this will automatically be in your PATH the next time you login
</p>
<p>And now a local directory for our various libraries</p>
<pre>$ mkdir -p ~/lib/python
$ echo "PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python:" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ echo "export PYTHONPATH" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
</pre>
<p>
This will add that directory to our Python path. If you happen to also use another language you can put things into ~/lib/ruby, ~/lib/perl as appropriate
</p>
<pre>$ mkdir ~/Projects
$ cd ~/Projects
</pre>
<p>
Here is where we will store copies of upstream software. What is the reason for using the repositories rather than packages? This allows us to checkout specific versions to match what our clients might be using. Or test things against newer versions of the upstream project.
</p>
<p>First, let's setup Django. I tend to use <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">git</a> by default, especially if the upstream is using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>. If they are using <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com">Mercurial</a> or <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/">Bazaar</a>, I use those directly.</p>

There are also plenty of other amazing things like <a href="http://haystacksearch.org/">haystack</a>, <a href="http://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/wiki/Home">piston</a>, <a href="http://www.satchmoproject.com/">satchmo</a>, etc. You can follow the same recipie for them too.
</p>

$ cd ~/lib/python

$ python

[GCC 4.4.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import south
&gt;&gt;&gt; south.__version__
'0.7.1'
</pre>
<p>
Finally, we want to be able to create Django projects. There is a great helper called django-admin that will do this. Let's put it into our path
</p>
<pre>$ cd ~/bin
$ ln -s ~/Projects/django/django/bin/django-admin.py
$ hash -r
</pre>
<p>
That last statment will cause your interpreter to re-read PATH and make anything new available for execution.
</p>
<p>
Now, you should go ahead and create your projects. There are a variety of ways to do this. However what I like to do is keep Django applications separate from the Django project. That way, they can easily be re-used if required.
</p>
<p>
So, for a project called 'foo', we might have
</p>
<pre>$ mkdir -p ~/Work/foo
$ cd ~/Work/foo
$ mkdir foo.example.com
$ mkdir templates
$ mkdir media
$ mkdir &lt;individual apps&gt;
</pre>
<p>
For each individual app, put them into the Python library. And you then have your re-usability from within Django. For a application called 'bar', you would do:
</p>
<pre>$ cd ~/Work/foo
$ django-admin.py startapp bar
$ cd ~/lib/python
$ ln -s ~/Work/foo/bar
</pre>
<p>
And now, in your Django foo.example.com setting.py's file you can put 'bar' as one the installed applications and things will Just Work
</p>
<p>
Obviously there are many way to slice this particular mango, but I've found that this works pretty well for me. You can spruce it up by revision controlling each directory in your project (I do) and also take advantage of things like <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> and <a href="http://fabfile.org/">Fabric</a> to make deploying just as easy as developing. But I'll leave those topics until a later date

Entry description: <img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/mjg59.png" width="69" height="85" alt="" align="right" />  The GNOME Foundation released their <a href="http://live.gnome.org/CodeOfConduct/SpeakerGuidelines">conference speaker guidelines</a> today. This is an important step not just in helping speakers know what's acceptable, but also in helping audience members understand in advance what the community is likely to find objectionable and ensure that they can feel comfortable in raising concerns.<br /><br />Of course, guidelines mean little without enforcement. My original draft of these suggested that event runners be able to stop presentations if they felt they were gratuitously in breach of the guidelines. Opinions on this were fairly strongly split, with several people concerned that this effectively allowed individuals to immediately shut down presentations with little oversight. That's a genuine concern, but it does seem to assume bad faith on the part of conference organisers in a way we've rarely (never?) seen. On the other hand, conferences in our field have endured presentations that have contained offensive material from start to finish. If an offended individual is in a minority then it's not easy for them to potentially challenge the audience by vocally expressing their unhappiness, and even standing up and leaving may be a difficult and obvious act.<br /><br />But I don't set the behavioural standards of the community, and attempting to enforce standards that people don't agree with isn't going to fly.

Entry description: <img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/mjg59.png" width="69" height="85" alt="" align="right" />  I've had the opportunity to look into the <a href="http://thejoojoo.com">Joojoo</a> tablet recently. It's an interesting device in various ways, ranging from the screen being connected upside down and everything having to be rotated before display, to the ACPI implementation that's so generic it has no support for actually attaching most embedded controller interrupts to ACPI devices and so relies on a hacked kernel that exposes individual interrupts as ACPI events that are parsed in userspace, to the ChangeOrientation binary that's responsible for switching between landscape and portrait modes containing gems like <tt>ps aux | grep fgplayer | grep -v grep</tt> and containing references to <tt>org.freedesktop.PandaSystem</tt>, a somewhat gratuitous namespace grab. Hardware-wise it seems to be little more than battery, generic nvidia reference design board and touchscreen with an accelerometer and LED glued to the chipset's GPIO lines. The entire impression is one of an ambitious project not backed up by the level of technical expertise required to get things done properly. Frankly, I think Michael Arrington <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/11/crunchpad-federal-lawsuit-filed-some-additional-thoughts/">came out of this</a> rather better than he could have done - behind the reasonably attractive UI, the entire device is pretty much held together by string and a following wind.<br /><br />Of course, releasing shoddily put together technology isn't generally illegal and from that point of view Fusion Garage aren't any worse than a number of products I've had the misfortune to actually spend money on. But they're distributing Linux (stock Ubuntu with some additional packages and a modified kernel) without any source or an offer to provide source. I emailed them last week and got the following reply:<cite><br /><br />Dear Sir,                                                                                                                                                                                            <br />                                                                                                                                                                                                        <br />we are still actively making changes to the joojoo software.

Debian packaging has been\ndone in subversion, with only the contents of <code>./debian</code> in version\ncontrol.

Each of these is constructed by deleting a large number of files from version control, and \noccasionally some last minute fiddling with README files and so on.</p></li>\n<li><p>The history of the release tags is not completely linear.

I\nended up importing each tarball on a temporary branch, and the merges\nwent smoother.

Entry title: David Bremner: Yet another tale of converting Debian packaging to Git
Entry link: http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner//blog/posts/convert-racket/
Entry description: <img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/bremner.png" width="100" height="128" alt="" align="right" />  <p><a href="http://racket-lang.org">racket</a> (previously known as plt-scheme) is an
interpreter/JIT-compiler/development environment with about 6 years of
subversion history in a converted git repo.  Debian packaging has been
done in subversion, with only the contents of <code>./debian</code> in version
control.  I wanted to merge these into a single git repository.</p>

<p>The first step is to create a repo and fetch the relevant history.</p>

git svn fetch <span class="hl sym">-</span>A<span class="hl kwb">$AUTHORS</span>
git branch debian
</pre>

<p>A couple points to note:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At some point there were huge numbers of renames when then the project renamed itself, hense the setting for <code>merge.renameLimit</code></p></li>
<li><p>Note the use of an authors file to make sure the author names and emails are reasonable in the imported history.</p></li>
<li><p>git svn creates a branch master, which we will eventually forcibly overwrite; we stash that branch as <code>debian</code> for later use.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now a couple complications arose about upstream's git repo.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Upstream releases seperate source tarballs for unix, mac, and windows. Each of these is constructed by deleting a large number of files from version control, and 
occasionally some last minute fiddling with README files and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>The history of the release tags is not completely linear. For example, </p></li>

<p>The combination made my straight forward attempt at constructing a
history synched with release tarballs generate many conflicts.  I
ended up importing each tarball on a temporary branch, and the merges
went smoother.  Note also the use of "git merge -s recursive -X
theirs" to resolve conflicts in favour of the new upstream version.</p>

<p>The repetitive bits of the merge are collected as shell functions.</p>

<p>The entire merge script is <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/blog/files/convert-racket-upstream.sh">here</a>.  A typical step looks like </p>

<p>Finally, we have the comparatively easy task of merging the upstream
and Debian branches.  In one or two places git was confused by all of
the copying and renaming of files and I had to manually fix things up
with <code>git rm</code>.</p>

Entry description: <p>A while back, I
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Time_for_new__LDAP_schemas_replacing_RFC_2307_.html">complained
about the fact</a> that it is not possible with the provided schemas
for storing DNS and DHCP information in LDAP to combine the two sets
of information into one LDAP object representing a computer.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I discovered that a simple fix would be to make
the dhcpHost object class auxiliary, to allow it to be combined with
the dNSDomain object class, and thus forming one object for one
computer when storing both DHCP and DNS information in LDAP.</p>

<p>If I understand this correctly, it is not safe to do this change
without also changing the assigned number for the object class, and I
do not know enough about LDAP schema design to do that properly for
Debian Edu.</p>

<p>Anyway, for future reference, this is how I believe we could change
the
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dhc-ldap-schema-00">DHCP
schema</a> to solve at least part of the problem with the LDAP schemas
available today from IETF.</p>

Entry title: Bernd Zeimetz: creating a google sitemap for ikiwiki
Entry link: http://bzed.de//posts/2010/06/creating_a_google_sitemap_for_ikiwiki/
Entry description: <img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/bzed.png" width="73" height="98" alt="" align="right" />  <p>ikiwiki is <a href="http://ikiwiki.info/todo/Google_Sitemap_protocol/">not yet able</a> to create a Google sitemap internally, so I'm using <a href="http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=google-sitemapgen">google-sitemapgen</a>. To run it automatically when the website is being updated, I've changed the git hook to run it after the ikiwiki hook.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the ikiwiki setup file let git_wrapper point to a file which is not the post-update hook, so you're able to run it from your own skript. I'm using <em>/path/to/myikiwiki.git/hooks/post-update.ikiwiki</em>.</li>
<li>Write a skript which runs as post-update hook and executes the created hook from ikiwiki and google-sitemapgen with a proper configuration. My versions of both files are listed below.</li>
</ul>

Entry description: <h1>On software modularity</h1>

<p>Software modularity is good. You take many modular, reusable components and you
join them together to create a bigger software that is more than the sum of its
parts:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.enricozini.org/blog/pdo/../../2010/cazzeggio/voltron.jpg"><img src="http://www.enricozini.org/blog/pdo/../../2010/cazzeggio/voltron.jpg" alt="Voltron" height="233" width="317" /></a></p>

<p>But what happens if you try to put together all sorts of modular parts, each
independently designed by a smart person who believes that their way of doing
things is the best in the world?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.enricozini.org/blog/pdo/../../2010/cazzeggio/frankrobot.jpg"><img src="http://www.enricozini.org/blog/pdo/../../2010/cazzeggio/frankrobot.jpg" alt="A mess of a robot" height="616" width="358" /></a></p>

<p>It's not exactly easy to save the world in <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>This post has been brought to you after a lot of paid work on Python, WSGI and
all those sorts of mini/midi/maxi/meta/macro frameworks people built with them,
that always look really, really cool until you actually start to use them for
getting a serious job done.</p>

Entry title: David Welton: Ovi Lays an Egg
Entry link: http://journal.dedasys.com/2010/06/23/ovi-lays-an-egg
Entry description: <p>
	In the local dialect here in Padova, Italy, "ovi" means "eggs".  For those who aren't native English speakers, "to lay an egg" means to fail at something or do it poorly.  The connection is very appropriate.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	To see what it was about, and if it was worth pursuing, I decided to submit a couple of simple applications to Nokia's OVI store.  Nothing fancy, or that I'd spent much time developing, and they were actually little things I'd done for myself before the ovi.com store came out, but I had hoped to see about making a bit of money out of the time invested nonetheless.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	So I went ahead and started adding them, with a quick glance the publisher guidelines.  Too quick, as it turns out.  A month after submitting my application, their "QA" process lets me know my application is not going to be accepted because it's not signed.  Uh... yeah?  Couldn't you have simply run a script on the file I uploaded to tell me the same damn thing?  It's not exactly as if you have to have a human look at the file with a hex editor to determine whether it's signed or not.  My phone can tell, of course - presumably Nokia ought to be able to figure it out programmatically and let me know?  Sure, I should have read their big, long document prior to starting, but come on, it would have saved everyone time if their software had simply informed me that my application, being unsigned, was not ok.</p>
<p>
	Now, when it comes to signing, Java ME is pretty much the worst in the business, although Apple is giving them a run for their money.  At least Apple does it to make the applications good for their users (for their definition of good).</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Java ME:  Ovi suggests using http://javaverified.com/ - where it costs $200 to sign up, and then something like <strong>at least 75 euros</strong> to run an application through *their* whole process.  For each version.   The hell with that!</li>
	<li>
		Android: you have to pay $25 to get access to the marketplace, but can self-sign applications.  For free.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Nokia &amp; Larry.</li>
	<li>
		BlackBerry: I was sure this one was going to be expensive and painful given that BB is mostly aimed at big companies that could certainly spare the money.   It's not: $20 gets you a certificate that you can sign everything you want with, and it's pretty quick and painless to get it.  This is how Nokia ought to be doing things in terms of signing applications.</li>
	<li>
		Apple: $100 gets you the dev kit and then you can submit your apps to the somewhat bureaucratic and slow apple approval process.  Plus you have to own a mac to develop on, if you don't already have one.  But still, only $100 a year, and you can do as many apps as you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	So there you have it, Java ME involves more fees than the other ones, and is probably as slow and bureaucratic to boot. I'm not going to find out, though, this pretty much concludes my experiment with ovi.com - there's no way I'm going to spend all that money on a little fun application that I'd only sell for a few euros.  Being a fan of open source and openness in general, my next phone will certainly be Android based.</p>
<p>
	I think someone at Nokia probably realizes things are broken: they appear to be working on a way to make it not cost anything to sign Symbian apps.  But I don't have a Symbian app, so that's pretty useless for me.</p>
<p>
	Oh, and while I'm bitching about their whole process, their publisher interface was down all of last weekend in order to "<font><font size="2">add a new set of metadata which will improve the <span class="il">Ovi</span> Store user experience".  It took a whole weekend of downtime to add that?<br />
	</font></font></p>
<p>
	Furthermore, I signed up for Ovi as soon as it came out - I was going to push Hecl to it (but didn't bother at the time) but now it appears they want 50 euros from you <em>just to sign up</em>.  Here's a hint: save your money.</p>

Entry title: Steve Kemp: I am the edge!
Entry link: http://blog.steve.org.uk/i_am_the_edge_.html
Entry description: <img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/skx.png" width="76" height="105" alt="" align="right" />  <p>Over the past few years I've amassed a collection of a few thousand images taken with a succession of digital cameras.</p>
<p>I'm pretty good at organising images, in a directory hierarchy which
makes sense to me, in a few simple and broad categories:</p>
<pre>skx@birthday:~$ tree -L 1 ~/Images/
/home/skx/Images/
|-- Misc
|-- Parties
|-- People
|-- Pets &amp; Animals
`-- Travel
</pre>
<p>Beneath <tt>~/Images/People</tt>, for example, I have subdirectories for specific individuals (or a "Debian/" folder for Debian-people who've been snapped but don't warrant their own folder.)</p>
<p><tt>~/Images/Travel</tt> has things like <tt>Travel/Local/2010</tt>, <tt>Travel/Vienna/2008</tt>, etc.</p>
<p>In summary I have images of people, places, and things stored beneath what <i>should be</i> a reasonably discoverable directory hierarchy, however this just doesn't work.  I still struggle to find images - for example images of myself  might be located in <tt>~/Images/People/Self/*</tt>, but in practise I'm often included in <tt>~/Images/Travel/*</tt> as well.</p>
<p>A few times I've looked at using f-spot, digikam, and similar tools
to perform image-organisation (but not editing, or timelines, or
anything else.  Just organisation).   I've found I didn't like being
locked into their formats, didn't want them to copy my images to a
second location, and other gripes.  In the end I've forced myself to come up with a Steve-Specific-Solution.  Not for the first time, but I think I have just cause...</p>
<p>I'm now using the <tt>User-Comment</tt> field in the image's EXIF data to store tags.  (When it comes to EXIF data I keep camera-generated fields, but sometimes update/set "Copyright", "Comment", and "Title" fields.  So UserComment is one I've never used until now, and thus I run no risk of trashing existing meta-data.)</p>
<p>I've put together a simple perl script, called <tt>itag</tt>, which will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Index the tag information from all images beneath ~/Images into a DBM file.</li>
<li>Show the filenames of all images matching a tag, or tags.</li>
<li>Allow me to add tag(s) to an image (which both updates the EXIF data <i>and</i> updates the DBM "cache").</li>
</ul>
<p>This is enough for me to be able to see all images of "Edinburgh", via:</p>
<pre>~$ qiv --fullscreen --slide --delay 5 $(itag --search=edinburgh)
</pre>
<p>Similarly I could find myself:</p>
<pre>~$ itag --search=steve --search=people
</pre>
<p>I'm not sure it is useful to others, mostly on the basis that people probably  fall into their own routine when it comes to filing, and I suspect that people with <i>vast</i> collections of images will just get annoyed by the obscenely slow indexing process I've got.  (Hint: run "exiftool" on every /.jpe?g$/i file..)</p>
<p>Still its a simple enough idea and I think it should scale in the future - I can even see myself writing a wee GUI to do tag exploration and similar.  Just not today.</p>

{'summary_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.debian.org/rss20.xml', 'type': 'text/html', 'value': u'<h1>on the interaction of FOSS communities with EU research\nprojects</h1>\n<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Framework_Programme">7th\nFramework Programme</a> (or FP7) is a well-known European program\nto fund research projects and promote the creation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Research_Area">European\nResearch Area</a>. For some European countries, FP7-funded projects\nare so important that they can make the difference between an\ninstitution that has the resources to pursue its research &amp;\nteaching activities and an institution that doesn\'t, which will\nthen have hard time surviving.</p>\n<p>As part of FP7 and its previous editions, the European\nCommission (EC) has been funding research into <acronym title="Free, Libre, and Open Source Software">FOSS</acronym> for a while\nnow, with different degrees of "FOSS-involvement". Some projects\nroutinely use FOSS products, some fund the development of relevant\nFOSS projects (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pypy">PyPy</a>), some try to address\nshortcomings of specific communities (e.g. <a href="http://edos.debian.net/">EDOS</a> and <a href="http://mancoosi.org/">Mancoosi</a>, <small>on which you surely are\naware of my bias ...</small>), some others try to remove barriers\nto FOSS adoption in various contexts (e.g. <a href="http://flossinclude.org/">FLOSSinclude</a>). A nice <a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/stuff/FOSS_Factsheet2010.pdf"><strong>overview\nof EU-funded FOSS projects</strong></a> is available as a <a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/stuff/FOSS_Factsheet2010.pdf">leaflet</a>.</p>\n<p>As with all project funding initiatives: having a project funded\ndoes not mean it will be successfully. By analogy: the fact that\nthe project (proposal) mentions FOSS does not mean it will be\nsuccessful in interacting with FOSS communities. Luckily, the EC is\nwell aware of existing difficulties and is now <strong>seeking\ninput from FOSS communities</strong> to understand how to better\ninteract with them, from the standpoint of FP7 research\nprojects.</p>\n<p>That is why last week I\'ve joined, upon invitation and as a\nDebian representative, a meeting at the EC in Brussels on the above\ntopics. At the table we were about a dozen people, including\nrepresentatives of ongoing research projects (both from academia\nand large industries), EC commissioners, ... and Debian (i.e. yours\ntruly). Beside joining the brainstorming, what I\'ve brought to the\ntable are <a href="http://git.upsilon.cc/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=talks/20100616-fp7-oss.git;a=summary">\nsome thoughts</a> on <strong>best and worst practices</strong> on\nthe interaction between research projects and FOSS communities,\nanswering to some working questions.</p>\n<p>There is probably little to see in the slides for people\nbelonging to FOSS communities, as all suggestions would seem fairly\nobvious (e.g.: do not invent/use yet another FOSS license, do not\njail people into specific forges, do not expect people to work\n<em>at your place</em>, etc.).

Entry description: <h1>on the interaction of FOSS communities with EU research
projects</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Framework_Programme">7th
Framework Programme</a> (or FP7) is a well-known European program
to fund research projects and promote the creation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Research_Area">European
Research Area</a>. For some European countries, FP7-funded projects
are so important that they can make the difference between an
institution that has the resources to pursue its research &amp;
teaching activities and an institution that doesn't, which will
then have hard time surviving.</p>
<p>As part of FP7 and its previous editions, the European
Commission (EC) has been funding research into <acronym title="Free, Libre, and Open Source Software">FOSS</acronym> for a while
now, with different degrees of "FOSS-involvement". Some projects
routinely use FOSS products, some fund the development of relevant
FOSS projects (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pypy">PyPy</a>), some try to address
shortcomings of specific communities (e.g. <a href="http://edos.debian.net/">EDOS</a> and <a href="http://mancoosi.org/">Mancoosi</a>, <small>on which you surely are
aware of my bias ...</small>), some others try to remove barriers
to FOSS adoption in various contexts (e.g. <a href="http://flossinclude.org/">FLOSSinclude</a>). A nice <a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/stuff/FOSS_Factsheet2010.pdf"><strong>overview
of EU-funded FOSS projects</strong></a> is available as a <a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/stuff/FOSS_Factsheet2010.pdf">leaflet</a>.</p>
<p>As with all project funding initiatives: having a project funded
does not mean it will be successfully. By analogy: the fact that
the project (proposal) mentions FOSS does not mean it will be
successful in interacting with FOSS communities. Luckily, the EC is
well aware of existing difficulties and is now <strong>seeking
input from FOSS communities</strong> to understand how to better
interact with them, from the standpoint of FP7 research
projects.</p>
<p>That is why last week I've joined, upon invitation and as a
Debian representative, a meeting at the EC in Brussels on the above
topics. At the table we were about a dozen people, including
representatives of ongoing research projects (both from academia
and large industries), EC commissioners, ... and Debian (i.e. yours
truly). Beside joining the brainstorming, what I've brought to the
table are <a href="http://git.upsilon.cc/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=talks/20100616-fp7-oss.git;a=summary">
some thoughts</a> on <strong>best and worst practices</strong> on
the interaction between research projects and FOSS communities,
answering to some working questions.</p>
<p>There is probably little to see in the slides for people
belonging to FOSS communities, as all suggestions would seem fairly
obvious (e.g.: do not invent/use yet another FOSS license, do not
jail people into specific forges, do not expect people to work
<em>at your place</em>, etc.). Still, I assure you that most of
them were not obvious for EC commissioners and that they have been
very much interested in hearing Debian feedback, which is perceived
has having <strong>no other interest than serving Free
Software</strong>. I'm personally very proud of the fact that
<strong>Debian</strong> was there, as a purely community-driven
project run by volunteers, <strong>whose opinion is clearly valued
by an important program as FP7 is</strong>.</p>
<p>Various possible next steps have been discussed: from drafting
guidelines that will help reviewers in evaluating the commitment of
project proposals to FOSS communities, to create a scenario-based
license chooser based on the needs of FP7 projects. While I did not
volunteer to take part in <em>all</em> such initiatives, I'll keep
you posted of advancements.</p>

{'summary_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.debian.org/rss20.xml', 'type': 'text/html', 'value': u'<p>Terah has been having thyroid troubles for some time now (you can <a href="http://forest.complete.org/?s=thyroid">read about it on her blog</a>).  Today was the day for it to be removed.</p>\n<p>This procedure is somewhat delicate.  Running through each half of the thyroid are nerves that control the vocal chords.  Also embedded in each half are tiny parathyroids, which regulate the body\u2019s calcium levels.  Losing either of these things in one half of the thyroid is no big deal, but losing either of them entirely can be serious.  For this reason, the general plan was for Terah to have half of her thyroid out, unless it was obvious in surgery that it would be a health risk to leave the other half in, or that it was obvious that the removal of the first half had successfully preserved the nerves and parathyroids.</p>\n<p>Jacob and Oliver spent the night with my parents last night \u2014 an event that Jacob was incredibly excited about.  I came home last night to find him running in circles in the kitchen.  I had this conversation with him:</p>\n<p>Me: Jacob, are you excited about something?</p>\n<p>Jacob: Yes!</p>\n<p>Me: What are you excited about?</p>\n<p>Jacob: I don\u2019t know.  (He usually says this when he doesn\u2019t want to say, but I figured it was his pending overnight stay)</p>\n<p>.. a minute later ..</p>\n<p>Jacob: I am excited about something blue.</p>\n<p>Me: [genuinely confused]  Hmmm\u2026.   I don\u2019t know what blue thing you might be excited about.  Can you tell me?</p>\n<p>Jacob: A blue house!</p>\n<p>Me: Oh, is it grandma and grandpa\u2019s blue house?</p>\n<p>Jacob: YEAH!  Now you\u2019ve got it!  I\u2019m so excited!</p>\n<p>He was still running in circles the whole time.</p>\n<p>So Jacob and Oliver left, and Terah and I worked on the house.</p>\n<p>This morning, we arrived at the hospital at 6:15 to check in.  At usual, the staff there was incredibly friendly and helpful.  And two of them made connections: one of the intake nurses had taught at the college where my dad works, and another nurse knows his cousin.  Living where we do, we were not surprised by this.  (You sort of wonder how many connections you\u2019ll make at a place like this.)</p>\n<p>The surgery area is right next to the ER, and people waiting for people in surgery normally wait there.  Having got my fill of the TV playing infomercials for the morning in the 5 minutes we sat there, I arranged to wait in the cafeteria (which is large and quiet in the middle of the morning) and they just called my cell phone when Terah was done.</p>\n<p>I was with Terah for as long as possible, then ate breakfast in the cafeteria, walked over to the doctor\u2019s office next door for my weekly allergy shots, and then waited with my Kindle in the cafeteria.  They called, and a little while later the surgeon explained how the surgery went: far easier than they had expected.  He was confident the left side surgery went well, and so took out the whole thing \u2014 and was confident the right side removal also went well.</p>\n<p>I went to wait in Terah\u2019s room for her to exit recovery, and our pastor and his daughter showed up to wait too.  When she arrived, she was very tired but said a few words before going to sleep.  Our pastor gave the two of us a minute before coming in, and read a selection from Psalm 139 before leaving.</p>\n<p>I then mostly waited with my Kindle some more until she woke up.  I brought back some lunch from the cafeteria, and eventually Terah woke up.  We chatted just a bit (it was mostly me talking).  I went to pick up the boys, and brought them to the hospital.  They were glad to see her.</p>\n<p>But then, the dilemma: I had promised Jacob that we would eat in the \u201chospital restaurant\u201d, but it was only 4 and they didn\u2019t start serving supper until 5.  Jacob somehow remembered that we \u201cwent exploring\u201d in the hospital when Oliver was born 11 months ago, and had been talking about doing this already.  So off we went: Jacob sometimes \u201chelping\u201d me push Oliver\u2019s stroller, sometimes running on ahead, enjoying himself and spelling out letters on big signs on the walls.  We got a whole bunch of smiles and compliments.  Oliver was laughing, and Jacob was happy and well-behaved.  We went towards the cafeteria at 4:30 and I got Jacob some of their free lemonade.  He was complaining about not eating, and I remembered that he noticed a nurse walking out of there with an ice cream cone while we were exploring.</p>\n<p>Obviously the soft-serve machine was already up, so I got him and me ice cream cones.  I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be talking about the hospital ice cream for days.  Anyhow, it took him about half an hour to eat it, so it was perfect timing for supper.  We ate, went back to see Terah, and then headed out.  I do believe that these may be the only two boys I know of that actually think of a hospital as a fun place to go.  It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if Jacob asks to go back there.</p>\n<p>Both boys fell asleep on the way home.  Jacob, unfortunately, had a rather significant accident, possibly due to the large amounts of free lemonade he insisted on drinking.  And it was hot outside.  So I carried Jacob in, and he sort of groggily looked at me.  I suggested he take a nap on the rug in the kitchen (his room is upstairs) while I bring Oliver in.  He sort of collapsed onto the rug and was back asleep a few seconds later.  I got Oliver in, and brought down new shorts and an overnight pullup for Jacob.  Put them on, had him use the toilet, and got him in bed.  By that time, Oliver was awake and hungry.  So I got him fed, and neither one of them quite went to sleep easily \u2014 but they did.

<dt>IT Taxes</dt>
<dd>I just want to flag this one up as a special interest: the telephone tax is killed off before it starts.  Yippee!  But now we get to wait and see how “the government will support private investment” to get universal provision of fast broadband. I’ve no problem with tax relief for the video games industry being scrapped - why should any type of software get special treatment?</dd>
<dt>VAT up 2.5% to 20% from 4 January 2011</dt>
<dd>This seems bad for everyone. It’s a bit less bad for our co-op because we have some international suppliers, whose sales tax rates won’t change, but we buy a lot from the UK too and it hurts all our workers.</dd>
<dt>Personal Taxes</dt>
<dd>The basic income tax allowance rise of £1,000 is welcome, as is restoring the pension-earnings links.  More widely, the freezes in various things, increase in Capital Gains Tax and drop in cider tax all seem broadly good ideas.  The housing benefit £400 maximum is a bit mixed - how bad it is may depend how lenders react when borrowers get into difficulty.</dd>
<dt>Business Taxes</dt>
<dd>At a time when a VAT increase is called “unavoidable”, it stinks a bit to cut corporation tax, extend the 10% capital gains tax allowance and raise the employers’ National Insurance threshold. Of course, our co-op pays none of those, so it also hurts us by giving our competitors an advantage. </dd>
<dt>Business Incentives</dt>
<dd>George Osborne said he wants to tackle regional economic differences, but the big change in this budget is bad for all existing businesses outside London, the South-East and East: National Insurance exemptions for new businesses.
