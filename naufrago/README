================
1. Introduction
================

NÃ¡ufrago! is a simple RSS reader that allows reading news with
its images even when it's not afloat, or what's the same, without
being online. This is because there are people, like the author,
that not always has an Internet connection near, but wants to be
able to read articles/entries/posts with its images. This is the
leit motiv of the application.

============
2. Features
============

The majors ones would be:

 - Feed categorization in a single level tree.
 - Feed organization drag & dropping through categories.
 - Online/offline feed reading (including images).
 - Full screen mode for better feed reading.
 - Smart category folding/unfolding.
 - Important/permanent feed marking (recording).
 - Favicon support.
 - Tray iconization.
 - Feed import/export in OPML format.
 - Important and Unread folders.
 - Term searching capabilities.
 - Multilanguage (currently English, French, Polish, Italian, Catalan and Spanish).
 - Automatic update checker.

Whishlist:

 - More translations.

==========================
3. Requirements (minimum)
==========================

Software ones:

 - GNU/Linux (Squeeze/Testing or greater for the Debian package).
 - Python 2.5 or better.
 - python-gtk2 (Python gtk2 bindings).
 - python-pysqlite2 (Python sqlite3 bindings).
 - python-feedparser (Python feedparser bindings).
 - python-webkit (Python Webkit bindings).

In the hardware level, anything that can move the app. The author
development environment & daily usage is a Netbook with an Intel 
Atom 1,6Ghz with 1GB of RAM.

===============================
4. Reinventing the wheel, why?
===============================

If the look & functions of this app are nearly a mirror (with some 
exceptions) of Liferea (at least in aspect), why reinventing the
wheel? For many reasons. Mainly because the author could not find a
RSS client that worked offline including images, Liferea developers
don't admit feature requests (a respectable thing) and taking a look
at alien/third party source code requires twice the effort of creating
one of my own (warning, this is a personal opinion!). Reinventing the wheel
also helps learning, and it also can add new ways of doing things/features
that in other way could not have appeared.

==========================
5. Installation and usage
==========================

If you use the Debian package, you probably have this app installed and
with its dependencies solved. To start the app, go to the Internet GNOME
menu and clic its icon. In any case, you need Debian Squeeze/Testing or
greater to run the app (at least until Squeeze/Testing becomes the current
Stable ;)

If you use the tarball, unpackage it and install the mentioned dependencies.
Then you can run it -preferably- through the script "naufrago_launcher.sh".
All the archives & directories needed by the app will be created on the
directory that is executed. Optionally, if you want to use an icon/launcher
to start the app, you can use the one we ship you (naufrago.desktop) by
changing first the path to the "naufrago_launcher.sh" init script and putting
it on the corresponding directory (in a Debian with GNOME, the proper path would
be /usr/share/applications/).

=====================
6. Problems / Suport
=====================

The application attempts to willingly carry out its mission, but very
certainly it is not free of errors. If they occur, you can contact me 
detailing the problem as precisely as possible, and I will try to see
what happens in order to correct it.

============
7. License
============

This app is under the GPLv3. You should have received a copy with it.
Otherwise or if you detect a breach of irs terms, please contact the
author or the FSF. Your freedom it's in play!

8. Authors
============

For the moment, there's onlu one: Jordi Oliveras ( worbynet at gmail dot com ).
