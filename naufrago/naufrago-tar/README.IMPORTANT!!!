BEFORE RUNNING THE APP, please, make sure the following:

A) Having uncompressed the tarball, please, recursively
   change the permissions on 'naufrago' directory to your
   user. For example:
   
   chown -R youruser.youruser naufrago/

B) If you currently have Naufrago! 0.1 or 0.2 installed,
   do this in order to upgrade to 0.3 version:

   1. COPY the following directories and files from Naufrago!
   version 0.1 or 0.2 to this directory:

   - favicons
   - imagenes
   - naufrago.db

   You can do this by:

   cp -a old_naufrago/favicons naufrago/
   cp -a old_naufrago/imagenes naufrago/
   cp old_naufrago/naufrago.db naufrago/

   2. RUN the script named 'update_0.x_to_0.3.py' provided
   within this tarball. You can do it through one of the
   following ways:

   Option 1:
   chmod +x update_0.x_to_0.3.py && ./update_0.x_to_0.3.py

   Option 2:
   python update_0.x_to_0.3.py

   3. ENJOY. If there were no errors, you're done! Launch this new
   version of Naufrago! and enjoy!

 PROBLEMS
----------

Q. I ran the 0.3 app version before doing the upgrade
steps and now the app does not work well! Help!
A. If you run the 0.3 app version before doing previous upgrade
steps, please, delete the 'favicons' and 'imagenes' directories and
the 'naufrago.db' file and proceed with the above mentioned steps.

Q. At step 3, when I run the script, it says it cannot find the
database file.
A. Make sure you copied the 0.1 or 0.2 database on the same path
where the script is. Also make sure you have write permission on it.

Q. I did not used 0.1 or 0.2 version previously, what should I do?
A. Just ignore this whole file and run the 0.3 app happily :)

Q. Any other issue?
A. Please, let me know through the project's sourceforge tracker
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/naufrago/support) or by sending me
an email (worbynet@gmail.com).
