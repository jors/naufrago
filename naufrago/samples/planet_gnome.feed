But then there\u2019s a middle ground: information I learned but I might forget. And that\u2019s where Mallard has been helping for the last months \u2014 keeping medical notes.</p>\n<p><span id="more-2968"></span></p>\n<p>There are plenty of technologies I could use for this. In fact, one of the best candidates was Tomboy, but I didn\u2019t want to mix the other notes with my medical ones (the notebooks feature wasn\u2019t enough) and I needed the technology to handle tables. Then, there are plenty of wikis out there, but I didn\u2019t want to have an HTTP server in my netbook, and TiddlyWiki seemed too fragile for me (try control+left on your browser).</p>\n<p>Mallard is topic-oriented, which is exactly what I need. Being fond of IT and GNOME, editing Mallard XML should be easy enough, even if lists and specially tables are a little too cumbersome. IMHO no file format is completely future-proof, but Mallard is almost there, being an open XML format and counting with out-of-the-box tools to convert documents to HTML and XHTML.</p>\n<p>All my medical notes are placed in a single directory, and I created a launcher on the desktop which runs yelp with that directory as an argument. I believe this is the most convenient way for GNOME users. But at the beginning I used to run <code>gnome-doc-tool html *.page</code> and open <code>index.html</code> in a web browser.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m very happy about using Mallard for my medical notes. The gedit syntax highlight is excellent, even if I\u2019d like to use the XML snippets together with the Mallard-specific ones (but that\u2019s a gedit issue). I\u2019d like to thank the GNOME Documentation Team of helping me when I had trouble in the first steps, as well as for writing <a href="http://projectmallard.org/about/learn/index.html">excellent documentation</a> on the Mallard file format.</p>\n<p>Overall, Mallard is a great documentation system, both for software and non-software documentation.</p></div>', 'language': u'en'}], 'source': {'updated': u'2010-06-28T08:08:44Z', 'subtitle': u'Tradutor do GNOME para o portugu\xeas do Brasil', 'updated_parsed': (2010, 6, 28, 8, 8, 44, 0, 179, 0), 'links': [{'href': u'http://leonardof.org/tag/english/feed/', 'type': u'application/rss+xml', 'rel': u'self'}, {'href': u'http://leonardof.org', 'type': u'text/html', 'rel': u'alternate'}], 'title': u'Leonardo Fontenelle \xbb English', 'subtitle_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'Tradutor do GNOME para o portugu\xeas do Brasil'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'Leonardo Fontenelle \xbb English'}, 'link': u'http://leonardof.org', 'id': u'http://leonardof.org'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'value': u'Using Mallard for general purpose documentation', 'language': u'en'}, 'link': u'http://leonardof.org/2010/06/28/using-mallard-for-general-purpose-documentation/', 'author': u'Leonardo Fontenelle', 'author_detail': {'name': u'Leonardo Fontenelle'}, 'id': u'http://leonardof.org/?p=2968'}

Entry title: Ignorance, or spite
Entry link: http://paul.kishimoto.name/302
Entry description: <div><p>Some thoughts on the occasion of the G20 summit in Toronto.</p>
<p>The police presence and violent protest were both of a scale unprecedented for this city. The security cost, at over $1 billion, was also unprecedented in the history of the G-summits and is <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/g8-g20/news/sarkozy-says-his-g8g20-will-cost-one-tenth-of-canadas/article1619637/">unlikely to ever be equalled</a>.</p>
<p>Much ink will be shed on the taxonomy of protesters (a term which, apparently, also now includes opportunist vandals with no policy demands), the validity of their various motives and the contemptibility of their actions. Equally, the actions of individuals among the tens of thousands of police involved will be put under the microscrope.</p>
<p>Both those debates will prove fruitless. To me, it is more important to see the three outsized aspects of the event—police presence, violence and cost—as forseeable consequences of the unnecessary and astoundingly poor choice of a venue for the summit.</p>
<p>I have heard two believable theories about <em>how</em> choice was made — ignorance and spite.</p>
<p>The 'ignorance' theory was advanced on <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/2010/06/june-21-2010.html">CBC's The Current</a> by Deborah Cowen of the University of Toronto. She noted that the Conservative government, with no seats in Toronto, Montréal or Vancouver, has an essentially rural background on which it draws and little firsthand knowledge about how large cities <em>actually are</em>. The implication is that they might have honestly but falsely believed that the effect of promoting Toronto, Ontario and/or Canada would outweigh any disruption caused by security measures and protests.</p>
<p>The 'spite' theory (of my more cynical friends) holds that the disruption was expected and anticipated by the government. In this view, the decision was to be seen—and appreciated—by the Conservatives' rural base as a giant middle finger raised towards Toronto and its citizens.</p>
<p>The first explanation wins by Ockham's Razor, at least; but whichever is more accurate, it is certain the decision was made for political, not economical (read: cost-saving) reasons.</p>
<p>To explain a bit more <em>why</em> I think the choice was 'astoundingly poor,' and the consequences 'predictable' I will channel Jane Jacobs, late Torontonian, whose <em>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</em> I recently read and enjoyed. Any errors in my paraphrase of her writings are, of course, my own.</p>
<p>One of Jacobs' criteria for distinguishing Great (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/great">very big, large scale; important</a>) Cities is diversity of use. On a summer weekend in Toronto, the downtown streets might be used by shoppers, baseball fans, theatregoers, businesspeople, diners, marketers, people-watchers, store clerks, deliverymen, walkers, those passing through to the lake or parts west, east or north, local residents, café patrons, cyclists, taxi drivers, buskers, runners, transit staff, and a whole cast of others my memory is too weak to summon. These vast majority of these people are strangers to one another, but their mere presence civilizes the streets, so that events like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Creba">2005 Boxing Day shooting of Jane Creba</a> are truly rare, unexpected and shocking.</p>
<p>Jacobs contrasts diverse use with the atmosphere in single-use residential projects, where the same advantages (many eyes at all hours) are not enjoyed and, not coincidentally, comparatively more gang-related violence occurs.</p>
<p>During an event like the current summit, normal usage is supressed. Within the security perimeter, there is no use at all by locals. Security measures impede normal use in surrounding areas, so that the Blue Jays and theatres take their business elsewhere or cancel whole performances (even at large cost). People who would have attended these larger events have no reason to be in the same areas for meals and other secondary activities. The secondary businesses they would have frequented, always sensitive to demand, run reduced staffs, further depleting the stock of people on the streets. And so on. In the current, extraordinary situation, even residents flee who are able to stay with friends in the suburbs or out of town.</p>
<p>Note that at no point is a collective decision made along the lines of, "Let's turn over the streets to rioters!"; instead, the deadening is an aggregate result of reasonable responses by normal individuals.</p>
<p>The few uses that remain can be numbered on one hand: peaceful protesting, spectating (both amateur and professional), policing and violence. The dead streets are a boon only to those engaged in the latter two activities, who find it easier to identify members of the other groups without actual citizens around.</p>
<p>Without any hysterics about professional anarchists or police <em>agents provocateurs</em>, then, it is easy to see why emptying the city enables situations that would be impossible under everyday circumstances. That this can be done on the basis of accessible, popular writing from the 1960s makes me doubt that no one in government raised an objection to the choice of location. The city claims openly that it put forward the Exhibition grounds (which, note, are <em>already</em> largely empty) as an alternative.</p>
<p>Those voices were obviously disregarded when the decision was made, and that disregard is the root cause of everything we have witnessed.</p></div>

Since <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Architects_on_OOXML">\u201cmultiple independent implementations help a standard mature quicker and become more useful to its users\u201d</a>, me and others (<a href="http://github.com/yuvi/">David</a> for the decoder core and PPC optimizations,\xa0<a href="http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/">Jason</a> for x86 optimizations) decided that we should implement a native VP8 decoder in FFmpeg. This has several advantages from other approaches (e.g. linking to libvpx, which is Google\u2019s decoder library for VP8):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we can share code (and more importantly: optimizations) between FFmpeg\u2019s VP8 decoder and decoders for previous versions of the VPx codec series (e.g. the entropy coder is highly similar compared to VP5/6). Thus, your phone\u2019s future media player will be smaller and faster.</li>\n<li>since <a href="http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=377">H.264 (the current industry standard video codec) and VP8 are highly similar</a>, we can share code (and more importantly: optimizations) between FFmpeg\u2019s H.264 and VP8 decoders (e.g. intra prediction). Thus, again, your desktop computer\u2019s future media player will be smaller and faster.</li>\n<li>Since FFmpeg\u2019s native VP3/Theora and Vorbis decoders (these are video/audio codecs praised by free software advocates) already perform better than the ones provided by Xiph (libvorbis/libtheora), it is highly likely that our native VP8 decoder will (once properly optimized) also perform better than Google\u2019s libvpx. The pattern here is that since each libXYZ has to reinvent its own wheel, they\u2019ll always fall short of reaching the top. FFmpeg comes closer simply because our existing wheels are like what you\u2019d want on your next sports car.</li>\n<li>Making a video decoder is fun!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, we wrote <a href="http://archives.free.net.ph/message/20100622.192409.2256ce0a.ja.html">a video decoder</a> that heavily reuses existing components in FFmpeg, leading to a vp8.c file that is a mere 1400 lines of code (including whitespace, comments and headers) and another 450 for the DSP functions (the actual math backend of the codec, which will be heavily optimized using SIMD). And it provides binary-identical output compared to libvpx for all files in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webm/downloads/detail?name=vp8-test-vectors-r1.zip&can=2&q=">the vector testsuite</a>. libvpx\u2019 vp8/decoder/*.c plus vp8/common/*.c alone is over 10,000 lines of code (i.e. this excludes optimizations), with another &gt; 1000 lines of code in vpx/, which is the public API to actually access the decoder.</p>\n<p><a href="http://archives.free.net.ph/message/20100627.020145.174b2d18.en.html">Current work</a> is ongoing to optimize the decoder to outperform libvpx on a variety of computer devices (think beyond your desktop, it will crunch anything; performance becomes much more relevant on phones and such devices). More on that later.</p>\n<div id="attachment_228" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/rbultje/files/2010/06/vector15.png"><img src="http://blogs.gnome.org/rbultje/files/2010/06/vector15.png" title="vector15" height="262" width="320" alt="Google\'s Test Suite, Vector 15 screenshot" class="size-full wp-image-228" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Google\'s Test Suite, Vector 15 screenshot</p></div>\n<p>Things to notice so so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google\u2019s VP8 specs are not always equally useful. They only describe the baseline profile (0). Other profiles (including those part of the vector testsuite, i.e. 1-3) use features not described in the specifications, such as chroma fullpixel motion vector (MV) rounding, a bilinear motion compensation (MC) filter (instead of a subpixel six-tap MC filter). Several parts of the spec are incomplete (\u201cwhat if a MV points outside the frame?\u201d) or confusing (the MV reading is oddly spread through 3 sections in a chapter, where the code in each section specifically calls code from the previous section, i.e. they really are one section), which means that in the end, it\u2019s much quicker to just read libvpx source code rather than depend on the spec. Most importantly, the spec really is a straight copypaste of the decoder\u2019s source code. As a specification, that\u2019s not very useful or professional. We hope that over time, this will improve.</li>\n<li>Google\u2019s libvpx is full of (hopefully) well-performing assembly code, quite some of which isn\u2019t actually compiled or used (e.g. the PPC code), which makes some of us wonder what the purpose of its presence is.</li>\n<li>Now that VP8 is released, will Google release specifications for older (currently undocumented) media formats such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP7">VP7</a>?</li>\n</ul></div>', 'language': u'en'}], 'source': {'updated': u'2010-06-28T10:24:26Z', 'subtitle': u'Random thoughts', 'updated_parsed': (2010, 6, 28, 10, 24, 26, 0, 179, 0), 'links': [{'href': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/rbultje/feed/', 'type': u'application/rss+xml', 'rel': u'self'}, {'href': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/rbultje', 'type': u'text/html', 'rel': u'alternate'}], 'title': u'Ronald S.

Entry title: GSoC: Zeitgeist weekly report #5
Entry link: http://mhr3.blogspot.com/2010/06/gsoc-zeitgeist-weekly-report-5.html
Entry description: <div>Hey there!<br /><br />Another report here with a look-back at what I did this week and what is planned for the next week, so here we go:<br /><ul><li>I started to write a Totem plugin which allows searching for recent media logged in Zeitgeist, so far it's very similar to the Youtube plugin (probably because I borrowed the UI from there), but it indeed does search Zeitgeist. There were a few pecularities with the plugin, so I'll rant here a bit about the documentation - if TotemVideoList requires a reference to TotemObject, it'd be nice to mention this in the documentation - it's far from obvious that one needs to call g_object_set (video_list, "totem", totem_obj, NULL) for it to not crash when one clicks on an item in the widget. Then there were some other crashes when I didn't set "tooltip-column" property, but ok, that one wasn't that hard to figure out.<br />The plugin was pushed to zeitgeist-dataproviders[1], but as Seif said, it's not a dataprovider, so he removed it from there, and so far I do not know where we'll push these non-logging plugins. Anyway it's there but you have to revert to revision 78.</li><li>I helped Seif with Sezen, cause I got quite different data and it was loading very slowly for me - so I tried to use everywhere async gio calls, and after some tweaking it was working much better. <span class="fn">Btw.

When you make a task (in web interface or using the API) tags and subtasks are recognized and added to the task, new subtasks also inherit parent\u2019s tags. In reader view you can follow links to subtasks and tags, it\u2019s a nice way to navigate through tasks. Subtask links were implemented a couple of weeks ago but the feature was broken until this week.</p>\n<p>Read-write REST API is functional. For now it uses basic http authentication, someday it will use oauth but it\u2019s not a priority (yet). I\u2019ve also written a small and simple python client library that provides interface to the API, which will be used in the sync backend.</p>\n<p>As for the third point \u2013 I\u2019m glad I said \u201cstart writing\u201d instead of \u201cwrite\u201d. I did start, configuration interface works. Not much else. <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  I\u2019m looking at code of other backends, and I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around the system.</p>\n<p>And that is the only task I\u2019ll give myself for this week \u2013 make a sync backend. The bulk of final exams is this week, but I think I\u2019ll manage to do everything in time. After that, most of the major features of my summer of code project will be done and I\u2019ll be focusing on usability and interface for a while. That\u2019s great for blog readers as I\u2019ll finally have some new pictures to show.</p>\n<br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/karlojez.wordpress.com/84/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/karlojez.wordpress.com/84/" alt="" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/karlojez.wordpress.com/84/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/karlojez.wordpress.com/84/" alt="" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/karlojez.wordpress.com/84/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/karlojez.wordpress.com/84/" alt="" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/karlojez.wordpress.com/84/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/karlojez.wordpress.com/84/" alt="" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/karlojez.wordpress.com/84/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/karlojez.wordpress.com/84/" alt="" border="0" /></a> <img src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=karlojez.wordpress.com&blog=13743186&post=84&subd=karlojez&ref=&feed=1" alt="" border="0" /></div>', 'language': u'en'}], 'source': {'updated': u'2010-06-27T15:26:55Z', 'subtitle': u'A blog about summer, code, things, GNOME!, and getting the aforementioned things GNOME!', 'updated_parsed': (2010, 6, 27, 15, 26, 55, 6, 178, 0), 'links': [{'href': u'http://karlojez.wordpress.com/category/planet-gnome/feed/', 'type': u'application/rss+xml', 'rel': u'self'}, {'href': u'http://karlojez.wordpress.com', 'type': u'text/html', 'rel': u'alternate'}, {'href': u'http://karlojez.wordpress.com/osd.xml', 'type': u'application/opensearchdescription+xml', 'rel': u'search', 'title': u'BlogBlog'}, {'href': u'http://karlojez.wordpress.com/?pushpress=hub', 'type': u'text/html', 'rel': u'hub'}], 'title': u'BlogBlog \xbb Planet Gnome', 'subtitle_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'A blog about summer, code, things, GNOME!, and getting the aforementioned things GNOME!'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'BlogBlog \xbb Planet Gnome'}, 'link': u'http://karlojez.wordpress.com', 'logo': u'http://www.gravatar.com/blavatar/7c128e011e621c74d30731ad9d5f85be?s=96&d=http://s2.wp.com/i/buttonw-com.png', 'id': u'http://karlojez.wordpress.com'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'value': u'GTG web: The fifth report', 'language': u'en'}, 'link': u'http://karlojez.wordpress.com/2010/06/27/gtg-web-the-fifth-report/', 'author': u'karlojez', 'author_detail': {'name': u'karlojez'}, 'id': u'http://karlojez.wordpress.com/?p=84'}

So I\u2019ve used a <a href="http://www.google.com/phone" title="Google Nexus One">Nexus One</a> as a replacement until I managed to fix the N900. That gave me a chance to compare them.</p>\n<p>You should also know that I am entirely biaised as I was paid to make the VVoIP calling on Maemo incredibly awesome. I have no relationship with\xa0 Google and the did not pay me to make their stuff awesome (so it is not awesome). The opinions stated here are mine and mine only. They are not approved by my employer Collabora, any of our clients or competitors, the Queen or anyone else than me.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m comparing both devices with the latest software version as delivered by their respective  OTA update system. So it is Maemo 5 PR1.2 for the N900 and Android 2.1  (Eclair) for the Nexus One. I make no claim of fairness. This is not a guide to chose which phone to buy.</p>\n<p><strong>Browser:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extensions: The N900 browser supports (badly) a few Firefox extensions (like Adblock Plus or Greasemonkey). They said, they\u2019re already quite useful. <strong>Maemo +1</strong></li>\n<li>Windows:\xa0 Maemo 5 also handles multiple windows as regular windows, while the Android browser has them hidden in a menu. I did not discover that menu until I had a \xab\xa0Too many windows open, can not open new window\xa0\xbb pop up. Also, the way \xab\xa0popup windows\xa0\xbb appear in Android is really annoying, especially the fact that they are hard (impossible?) to zoom. <strong>Maemo +1</strong></li>\n<li>Flash:\xa0 It\u2019s not really usable (more like really unusable). Flash video playback is really slow (since all decoding is done in software). Steve is right, Flash is a disaster on mobile devices. <strong>Maemo -1</strong></li>\n<li>Text column width cheating and reflowing: The Android browser has a nice feature where it scales the width of text columns to the screen width to be nicely readable. It tends to break the layout of some sites, but it\u2019s well worth it. Opera Mobile seems to do the same thing. But the Maemo browser doesn\u2019t. Newer Firefox Mobile builds seem to also lack that. This means it is also unusable in vertical mode. <strong>Android +1</strong></li>\n<li>Scrolling performance: The Maemo browser uses tiles for when scrolling, so if you scroll too fast, it has to work real hard to render the next tile. It was much smoother on Android. That said, I heard the Mozilla people are trying to fix this in Fennec 2. <strong>Android +1</strong></li>\n<li>Rotation: The vertical mode of the Android browser just works better than the half-baked rotation support in Maemo 5.\xa0 And holding it in one hand is much easier if its vertical. <strong>Android +1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Browser totals:\xa0\xa0 Maemo 21- Android 3</p>\n<p><strong>Contacts &amp; IM:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>IM protocols: Android only supports Google Talk out of the box, while Maemo supports\xa0 Skype, SIP and XMPP (including Google Talk) right of out of the box. And it is easy to add 3rd party support for other protocols (MSN, Yahoo!, etc) and it integrates fully into the existing system. <strong>Maemo +2</strong></li>\n<li>SMS/IM integration: SMS and IM are entirely separate in Android, but they are the same app in Maemo. <strong>Maemo +1</strong></li>\n<li>Metacontacts: Both platforms have metacontacts. Sadly, they are both incomplete. Contacts in both platforms include the basics: name, nickname, phone, email. Maemo can also link contacts from all IM accounts together, while Android only does it for Google Talk. But Android applications can put their own info in the contacts, so you can link in Facebook and Twitter contacts easily. On Maemo, well you can do it with Hermes, but you still don\u2019t get the phone number or email address from Facebook (blame them for it). <strong>Equal points</strong></li>\n<li>Synchronisation: Out of the box, Android only supports synchronization with Google\u2019s servers. Maemo only supports SyncML over USB (not over http) or Mail for Exchange. <strong>No points.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contacts &amp; IM totals: Maemo 3 \u2013 Android 0</p>\n<p><strong>Calling:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ringtone: The Nexus One ringtones are just not loud enough. I\u2019ve missed many calls because I just didn\u2019t hear it. My colleague complained it wasn\u2019t loud enough to wake him up making it useless as an alarm clock. That\u2019s a pretty big fault for a phone. <strong>Nexus One -2</strong></li>\n<li>Voice quality: I did not do any objective testing, but I feel that despite the active noise cancellation of the Nexus One (with a second microphone), I can still hear calls better on the N900. <strong>N900 +1</strong></li>\n<li>VoIP:\xa0 Android only has Google Voice (only works in the US) built in. Skype is only available from select providers. And I could not get any of the 10 SIP apps in the Market to work with SipPhone.com (a Google service). So no VoIP on Android for me. On the other hand, the N900 has excellent VoIP support (I know its excellent, it uses <a href="http://farsight2.freedesktop.org/" title="Farsight2">Farsight2</a>, my project!). Out of the box, it supports Skype, SIP as well as XMPP Jingle calls. That means Maemo support Google Talk compatible calls, but not Android. How ironic. <strong>Maemo +2</strong></li>\n<li>Video calls: There is no front-facing camera on the Nexus One. The N900 has awesome video calls, including GMail compatible calls (a mobile first)! As well as Skype compatible video calls (another mobile first). <strong>Maemo +1</strong></li>\n<li>Accepting calls: The \xab\xa0incoming call\xa0\xbb screen on Android has slide buttons. On Maemo 5, it has push buttons. Combined that with the fact that is auto-unlocks the screen when it rings and with the resistive screen, it means that I sometimes accidentally hang up or answer in my pocket. Really annoying. <strong>Maemo -1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Calling totals: N900 3 (Maemo 2) \u2013 Nexus one -2</p>\n<p><strong>E-Mail:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both devices have email clients supporting IMAP. Android also has a separate application for GMail. Since I don\u2019t use GMail, I did not try it seriously.</li>\n<li>Combined inbox: Android has a nice feature where the inboxes of all account are shown at once. <strong>Android +1</strong></li>\n<li>Searching: It\u2019s a funny thing. The Android mail application does not have any search feature. At least, Modest (the Maemo email client) has gained minimal searching in PR1.2. <strong>Maemo +0.5</strong></li>\n<li>Performance: The android mail app just feels faster and doesn\u2019t get stuck waiting for God knows what all the time. <strong>Android +2</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>E-Mail totals:\xa0 Maemo 0.5 \u2013 Android 3</p>\n<p><strong>Maps:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall: The Ovi Maps application for Maemo is a disaster, Google Maps just works on Android. <strong>Android +1 Maemo -1</strong> (I\u2019m giving a -1 because Ovi maps is so disappointing, they should have released the device without it)</li>\n<li>Network access: That said, Ovi Maps has one nice things, you can download maps, while Google Maps is just pre-rendered tiles, which means it always requires Internet Access.\xa0 <strong>Maemo +1</strong></li>\n<li>Navigation: Google has free navigation (in select countries), Ovi Maps for Maemo does not have navigation. <strong>Android +1</strong></li>\n<li>Voice commands: Android has them (including search), Maemo does not. <strong>Android +1</strong></li>\n<li>Search: Google Maps has Google search.. Ovi Maps has some crappy search that fails half the time if you don\u2019t spell the address exactly the way it expects it. Ovi Maps can not search for things that are not addresses (like a restaurant ou a gaz station). <strong>Android +2</strong></li>\n<li>Extras: Google Maps also does nice things like public transit. I wish they had bike routes in Canada. <strong>Android +1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Maps totals: Maemo 0 \u2013 Android 6</p>\n<p><strong>Camera &amp; Photos:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Camera Hardware: Both devices have 5 mega pixel cameras and they seem to have more or less similar performance. That said, I did not do any serious comparison. <strong>Equal points</strong></li>\n<li>Photo browser: The Android Gallery has a bit more bling, but it is the only built-in app that I\u2019ve seen crash on the Nexus One. But functionality-wise, they seem pretty similar. <strong> </strong><strong>Equal points</strong></li>\n<li>Button: The N900 has a hardware camera button. On the Nexus One, it is an on screen button. Touching the on-screen button while holding the camera in the right direction is really hard. <strong>N900 +1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Camera &amp; Photos total: N900 1 \u2013 Android 0</p>\n<p><strong>Hardware:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Size: The Nexus One is quite a bit thinner, the N900 is a pretty bulky device. Good thing I don\u2019t like thigh pants. <strong>Nexus One +1</strong></li>\n<li>Keyboard: The N900 has one, the Nexus One doesn\u2019t. I though it was a fatal flaw until I discovered <a href="http://www.swypeinc.com/" title="Swype">Swype</a>, which is really awesome\u2026 if you only write in one language. But I write in both French and English.. Sometimes I send one message in French and the next one in English.. Sometimes I mix languages in the same message. Swype only does one language at a time. That\u2019s not a problem with the keyboard. So <strong>N900 +1</strong></li>\n<li>Screen resolution: The same. <strong>Equal points</strong></li>\n<li>Touch screen: The N900 has a resistive touch screen, the Nexus One has a capacitive screen. Everyone is saying that capacitive touchscreens are nicer\u2026 I\u2019m unconvinced. Yes, you need more pressure on the N900.. But the Nexus One\u2019s screen sometimes strangely fails to react. It is also much less precise. That said, resistive screens have the annoying habit of reacting to pockets (especially annoying when it rings). <strong>Equal points</strong></li>\n<li>Digital compass: The Nexus One has one, N900 doesn\u2019t. <strong>Nexus One +0.5</strong></li>\n<li>Volume buttons: On Android, when not in the music app or in a call, the volume button control the ringer volume. That means it\u2019s really easy to turn it even lower than it already is. This is especially annoying sine the Nexus One volume buttons are too easy to push. <strong>Nexus One -1</strong></li>\n<li>Included Flash memory: The N900 has 32 GB. The Nexus One has none. Both have a microSD slot. The Nexus One did come with a 4GB card. That\u2019s just not enough, I have 7 GB just for music on my N900, and that replaced a full 30GB iPod. <strong>N900 +2</strong></li>\n<li>TV out: The N900 has TV-out, the Nexus One doesn\u2019t. I though it was completely useless (its just analog low def). But it was really useful when I cracked the LCD. <strong>N900 +0.5</strong></li>\n<li>Bands: The Nexus One is available in both AT&amp;T/Rogers/Bell/Telus (850/1900) and T-Mobile USA (900/1700) bands for 3G. The N900 is only sold for the T-Mobile USA band (900/1700). Which mean no 3G in Quebec until Videotron launches its network (and they are one year late already). Both phones support the European 2100 band. And they\u2019re both quand-band for GSM/EDGE. <strong>Nexus One +1</strong></li>\n<li>FM transmitter/receiver: The N900 has a FM transmitter and a FM receiver. I\u2019ve only used them briefly. <strong>N900 +0.5</strong></li>\n<li>Speakers: The build-in speaker of the Nexus One is terrible, the N900 has some of the best stereo speakers I\u2019ve seen on this kind of device. <strong>N900 +1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hardware totals: N900 5 \u2013 Nexus One 1.5</p>\n<p><strong>3rd Applications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Availability: There are lots of apps on the Android store. There are TWO paid games on the Ovi store for the N900 as of today (when it is not down). That said, Maemo has a lot of ports of existing Open Source apps in Maemo Extras. That said, many of the apps in the Android Market are terrible\u2026\xa0 <strong>Android +1</strong></li>\n<li>Application installer: The Android Market (which also acts as an app installer) just works. The Maemo 5 application installer is a complete disaster. It is user hostile and developer hostile. <strong>Maemo -1</strong></li>\n<li>Developer story: Nokia decided to scrap most of the Maemo 5 platform and review everything with a brand new toolkit. They\u2019re completely unable to get a straight story about developer APIs. I think that is in part because they also want people to do Symbian apps. Nokia please, please, just forget about Symbian apps, just use J2ME like on S40. Google has provided a stable Java API.. But not a stable C/C++ API. <strong>Maemo -2</strong></li>\n<li>Python: A lot of the Maemo apps are in Python and therefore are  memory hungry (on a memory starved device). <strong>Maemo -1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>3rd Application totals: Maemo -4 \u2013 Android 1</p>\n<p><strong>User experience:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maemo\u2019s greatest weakness is the out of memory handling. There is only 256 megs of RAM and 768 megs of swap. That means that as soon as you do too many things, it starts swapping and the performance becomes terrible. This is made even worst by the fact that application startup is really slow, so many applications are in pre-started. Nokia should put a lot more memory in the next device and seriously fix the application startup time. Android has a nice thing where apps can serialize their content and be shut down when the system in under memory pressure. This leads to a much better impression of performance. <strong>Android +4</strong></li>\n<li>CPU speed: The Nexus One has a 1Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU, much faster than the 600Mhz TI OMAP 3430 of the N900. <strong>Nexus One +1</strong></li>\n<li>The real \xab\xa0multitasking\xa0\xbb is much nicer in Maemo5, Android just fakes multitasking by having applications save their state and restart at the same point. That means you can not load two web pages at the same time or anything like that. <strong>Maemo +1</strong></li>\n<li>Both have multiple desktops with applets. Sadly, when I load my N900 desktops with applets, the system becomes sluggish. <strong>Maemo -0.5</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>User experience totals: Maemo 0.5 \u2013 Nexus One 6 (Android 4)</p>\n<p><strong>Geek experience:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maemo is the ultimate mobile Geek OS. Having an x-term built-in is just amazing. <strong>Maemo +3</strong></li>\n<li>Maemo is a real Linux desktop-like operating system. To anyone who knows Linux, it just feels right. Android is the Linux kernel + Android. It was done in secret in a corner and Google has not made any serious attempt to join the great community. They re-wrote everything from scratch all the way to writing their own libc. <strong>Maemo +2</strong></li>\n<li>The choice language on Android is Java (beurk!). On Maemo is it C (or C++). <strong>Maemo +1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Geek experience totals: Maemo 6 \u2013 Android 0</p>\n<p><strong>Other stuff:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Media player: I didn\u2019t really try the Android media player since there isn\u2019t enough space on the SD card to hold any significant amount of music.</li>\n<li>Notes: Android does not seem to come with a built-in notes apps. The Maemo Notes app is just pretty bad. They could have just shipped ConBoy instead\u2026</li>\n<li>PDF reader: the PDF reader on Maemo 5 is terrible, the Android one seemed kind of ok (but not great either)</li>\n<li>RSS Reader: Does Android have one? I use the web-based Google Reader  anyway</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Total:</strong> N900 16 (Maemo 9) \u2013 Nexus One\xa0 17.5 (Android 17)</p>\n<p>The Nexus One is really being dragged down by its its hardware. Especially when it comes to the bad speaker quality and the low ringer volume.. Did I mention how much it annoyed me ? That said, Android is pretty good. Better IM integration would be a\xa0 big plus. And some VoIP too.</p>\n<p>Our Nokian friends have their work cut out for them. First, they need to fix the memory handling story on Meego. Running out of memory and swapping all the time is just annoying. An almost desktop-class operating system requires desktop-class amounts of RAM (that means more of it). Ovi Maps needs a lot of work, hopefully they can work a deal with Google to get decent search in there.\xa0 The browser could get its share of small screen friendliness and a performance upgrade. If they fix these few problems, Meego (as the future of Maemo is called) could very well be a success.</p>\n<p>Were it not for its high geek factor (built-in X Terminal!), the N900 would have lost badly. That said, it\u2019s still my favorite phone ever (did I mention I was horribly biaised?)</p></div>', 'language': u'en'}], 'source': {'updated': u'2010-06-28T02:11:41Z', 'subtitle': u"Tester's very own blog!", 'updated_parsed': (2010, 6, 28, 2, 11, 41, 0, 179, 0), 'links': [{'href': u'http://www.tester.ca/category/english/feed/', 'type': u'application/rss+xml', 'rel': u'self'}, {'href': u'http://www.tester.ca', 'type': u'text/html', 'rel': u'alternate'}], 'title': u'Le blog de Tester \xbb English', 'subtitle_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u"Tester's very own blog!"}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'Le blog de Tester \xbb English'}, 'link': u'http://www.tester.ca', 'id': u'http://www.tester.ca'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'value': u'N900 vs Nexus One: a comparison', 'language': u'en'}, 'link': u'http://www.tester.ca/2010/06/26/n900-vs-nexus-one-a-comparison/', 'author': u'Tester', 'author_detail': {'name': u'Tester'}, 'id': u'http://www.tester.ca/?p=310'}

Entry title: On the Brokenness of File Locking
Entry link: http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/locking.html
Entry description: <div><p>It's amazing how far Linux has come without providing for proper file
locking that works and is usable from userspace. A little overview why file
locking is still in a very sad state:</p>

<p>To begin with, there's a plethora of APIs, and all of them are awful:</p>

<ul>

<li>POSIX File locking as available with <tt>fcntl(F_SET_LK)</tt>: the POSIX
locking API is the most portable one and in theory works across NFS. It can do
byte-range locking. So much on the good side. On the bad side there's a lot
more however: locks are bound to processes, not file descriptors. That means
that this logic cannot be used in threaded environments unless combined with a
process-local mutex. This is hard to get right, especially in libraries that do
not know the environment they are run in, i.e. whether they are used in
threaded environments or not. The worst part however is that POSIX locks are
automatically released if a process calls <tt>close()</tt> on <i>any</i> (!) of
its open file descriptors for that file. That means that when one part of a
program locks a file and another by coincidence accesses it too for a short
time, the first part's lock will be broken and it won't be notified about that.
Modern software tends to load big frameworks (such as Gtk+ or Qt) into memory
as well as arbitrary modules via mechanisms such as NSS, PAM, gvfs,
GTK_MODULES, Apache modules, GStreamer modules where one module seldom can
control what another module in the same process does or accesses. The effect of
this is that POSIX locks are unusable in any non-trivial program where it
cannot be ensured that a file that is locked is <i>never</i> accessed by
any other part of the process at the same time. Example: a user managing
daemon wants to write <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> and locks the file for that. At
the same time in another thread (or from a stack frame further down)
something calls <tt>getpwuid()</tt> which internally accesses
<tt>/etc/passwd</tt> and causes the lock to be released, the first thread
(or stack frame) not knowing that. Furthermore should two threads use the
locking fcntl()s on the same file they will interfere with each other's locks
and reset the locking ranges and flags of each other. On top of that locking
cannot be used on any file that is publicly accessible (i.e. has the R bit set

otherwise effectively give arbitrary users a way to indefinitely block
execution of any process (regardless of the UID it is running under) that wants
to access and lock the file. This is generally not an acceptable security risk.
Finally, while POSIX file locks are supposedly NFS-safe they not always really
are as there are still many NFS implementations around where locking is not properly
implemented, and NFS tends to be used in heterogenous networks. The biggest
problem about this is that there is no way to properly detect whether file
locking works on a specific NFS mount (or any mount) or not.</li>

<li>The other API for POSIX file locks: <tt>lockf()</tt> is another API for the
same mechanism and suffers by the same problems. One wonders why there are two
APIs for the same messed up interface.</li>

<li>BSD locking based on <tt>flock()</tt>. The semantics of this kind of
locking are much nicer than for POSIX locking: locks are bound to file

between threads and can even be inherited across <tt>fork()</tt> and

<h4>The Disappointing Summary</h4>

<p>File locking on Linux is just broken. The broken semantics of POSIX locking
show that the designers of this API apparently never have tried to actually use
it in real software. It smells a lot like an interface that kernel people
thought makes sense but in reality doesn't when you try to use it from

<p>Here's a list of places where you shouldn't use file locking due to the

$HOME might be NFS and locks generally are not reliable there. The same applies
to every other file system that might be shared across the network. If the file
you want to lock is accessible to more than your own user (i.e. an access mode

framework such as Gtk+ or Qt or any of the module-based APIs such as NSS, PAM,
... forget about about POSIX locking. If you care about portability, don't use
file locking.</p>

<p>Or to turn this around, the only case where it is kind of safe to use file locking

Often, when people look for such an ID to use they pick\nthe wrong one because semantics and lifetime or the IDs are not clear. Here's a\nlittle incomprehensive list of IDs accessible on Linux and how you should or\nshould not use them.</p>\n\n<h4>Hardware IDs</h4>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><tt>/sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid</tt>: The main board product UUID, as\nset by the board manufacturer and encoded in the BIOS DMI information. It may\nbe used to identify a mainboard and only the mainboard. It changes when the\nuser replaces the main board. Also, often enough BIOS manufacturers write bogus\nserials into it. In addition, it is x86-specific. Access for unprivileged users\nis forbidden. Hence it is of little general use.</li>\n\n<li><tt>CPUID/EAX=3</tt> CPU serial number: A CPU UUID, as set by the\nCPU manufacturer and encoded on the CPU chip. It may be used to identify a CPU\nand only a CPU. It changes when the user replaces the CPU. Also, most modern\nCPUs don't implement this feature anymore, and older computers tend to disable\nthis option by default, controllable via a BIOS Setup option. In addition, it\nis x86-specific. Hence this too is of little general use.</li>\n\n<li><tt>/sys/class/net/*/address</tt>: One or more network MAC addresses, as\nset by the network adapter manufacturer and encoded on some network card\nEEPROM. It changes when the user replaces the network card. Since network cards\nare optional and there may be more than one the availability if this ID is not\nguaranteed and you might have more than one to choose from. On virtual machines\nthe MAC addresses tend to be random. This too is hence of little general use.</li>\n\n<li><tt>/sys/bus/usb/devices/*/serial</tt>: Serial numbers of various USB\ndevices, as encoded in the USB device EEPROM. Most devices don't have a serial\nnumber set, and if they have it is often bogus. If the user replaces his USB\nhardware or plugs it into another machine these IDs may change or appear in\nother machines. This hence too is of little use.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are various other hardware IDs available, many of which you may\ndiscover via the ID_SERIAL udev property of various devices, such hard disks\nand similar. They all have in common that they are bound to specific\n(replacable) hardware, not universally available, often filled with bogus data\nand random in virtualized environments. Or in other words: don't use them, don't\nrely on them for identification, unless you really know what you are doing and\nin general they do not guarantee what you might hope they guarantee.</p>\n\n<h4>Software IDs</h4>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><tt>/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id</tt>: A random ID that is regenerated\non each boot. As such it can be used to identify the local machine's current\nboot. It's universally available on any recent Linux kernel. It's a good and\nsafe choice if you need to identify a specific boot on a specific booted\nkernel.</li>\n\n<li><tt>gethostname()</tt>, <tt>/proc/sys/kernel/hostname</tt>: A non-random ID\nconfigured by the administrator to identify a machine in the network. Often\nthis is not set at all or is set to some default value such as\n<tt>localhost</tt> and not even unique in the local network. In addition it\nmight change during runtime, for example because it changes based on updated\nDHCP information. As such it is almost entirely useless for anything but\npresentation to the user. It has very weak semantics and relies on correct\nconfiguration by the administrator. Don't use this to identify machines in a\ndistributed environment. It won't work unless centrally administered, which\nmakes it useless in a globalized, mobile world. It has no place in\nautomatically generated filenames that shall be bound to specific hosts. Just\ndon't use it, please. It's really not what many people think it is.\n<tt>gethostname()</tt> is standardized in POSIX and hence portable to other\nUnixes.</li>\n\n<li>IP Addresses returned by SIOCGIFCONF or the respective Netlink APIs: These\ntend to be dynamically assigned and often enough only valid on local networks\nor even only the local links (i.e. 192.168.x.x style addresses, or even\n169.254.x.x/IPv4LL). Unfortunately they hence have little use outside of\nnetworking.</li>\n\n<li><tt>gethostid()</tt>: Returns a supposedly unique 32-bit identifier for the\ncurrent machine. The semantics of this is not clear. On most machines this\nsimply returns a value based on a local IPv4 address. On others it is\nadministrator controlled via the <tt>/etc/hostid</tt> file. Since the semantics\nof this ID are not clear and most often is just a value based on the IP address it is\nalmost always the wrong choice to use. On top of that 32bit are not\nparticularly a lot. On the other hand this is standardized in POSIX and hence\nportable to other Unixes. It's probably best to ignore this value and if people\ndon't want to ignore it they should probably symlink <tt>/etc/hostid</tt> to\n<tt>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</tt> or something similar.</li>\n\n<li><tt>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</tt>: An ID identifying a specific Linux/Unix\ninstallation. It does not change if hardware is replaced. It is not unreliable\nin virtualized environments. This value has clear semantics and is considered\npart of the D-Bus API. It is supposedly globally unique and portable to all\nsystems that have D-Bus. On Linux, it is universally available, given that\nalmost all non-embedded and even a fair share of the embedded machines ship\nD-Bus now.  This is the recommended way to identify a machine, possibly with a\nfallback to the host name to cover systems that still lack D-Bus. If your\napplication links against <tt>libdbus</tt>, you may access this ID with\n<tt>dbus_get_local_machine_id()</tt>, if not you can read it directly from the file system.</li>\n\n<li><tt>/proc/self/sessionid</tt>: An ID identifying a specific Linux login\nsession. This ID is maintained by the kernel and part of the auditing logic. It\nis uniquely assigned to each login session during a specific system boot,\nshared by each process of a session, even across su/sudo and cannot be changed\nby userspace. Unfortunately some distributions have so far failed to set things\nup properly for this to work (Hey, you, Ubuntu!), and this ID is always\n<tt>(uint32_t) -1</tt> for them. But there's hope they get this fixed\neventually. Nonetheless it is a good choice for a unique session identifier on\nthe local machine and for the current boot. To make this ID globally unique it\nis best combined with <tt>/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id</tt>.</li>\n\n<li><tt>getuid()</tt>: An ID identifying a specific Unix/Linux user. This ID is\nusually automatically assigned when a user is created. It is not unique across\nmachines and may be reassigned to a different user if the original user was\ndeleted. As such it should be used only locally and with the limited validity\nin time in mind. To make this ID globally unique it is not sufficient to\ncombine it with <tt>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</tt>, because the same ID might be\nused for a different user that is created later with the same UID. Nonetheless\nthis combination is often good enough. It is available on all POSIX systems.</li>\n\n<li><tt>ID_FS_UUID</tt>: an ID that identifies a specific file system in the\nudev tree. It is not always clear how these serials are generated but this\ntends to be available on almost all modern disk file systems. It is not\navailable for NFS mounts or virtual file systems. Nonetheless this is often a\ngood way to identify a file system, and in the case of the root directory even\nan installation. However due to the weakly defined generation semantics the\nD-Bus machine ID is generally preferrable.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h4>Generating IDs</h4>\n\n<p>Linux offers a kernel interface to generate UUIDs on demand, by reading from\n<tt>/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid</tt>.

Entry title: On IDs
Entry link: http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/ids.html
Entry description: <div><p>When programming software that cooperates with software running on behalf of
other users, other sessions or other computers it is often necessary to work with
unique identifiers. These can be bound to various hardware and software objects
as well as lifetimes. Often, when people look for such an ID to use they pick
the wrong one because semantics and lifetime or the IDs are not clear. Here's a
little incomprehensive list of IDs accessible on Linux and how you should or
should not use them.</p>

<h4>Hardware IDs</h4>

<ol>

<li><tt>/sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid</tt>: The main board product UUID, as
set by the board manufacturer and encoded in the BIOS DMI information. It may
be used to identify a mainboard and only the mainboard. It changes when the
user replaces the main board. Also, often enough BIOS manufacturers write bogus
serials into it. In addition, it is x86-specific. Access for unprivileged users
is forbidden. Hence it is of little general use.</li>

<li><tt>CPUID/EAX=3</tt> CPU serial number: A CPU UUID, as set by the
CPU manufacturer and encoded on the CPU chip. It may be used to identify a CPU
and only a CPU. It changes when the user replaces the CPU. Also, most modern
CPUs don't implement this feature anymore, and older computers tend to disable
this option by default, controllable via a BIOS Setup option. In addition, it
is x86-specific. Hence this too is of little general use.</li>

<li><tt>/sys/class/net/*/address</tt>: One or more network MAC addresses, as
set by the network adapter manufacturer and encoded on some network card
EEPROM. It changes when the user replaces the network card. Since network cards
are optional and there may be more than one the availability if this ID is not
guaranteed and you might have more than one to choose from. On virtual machines
the MAC addresses tend to be random. This too is hence of little general use.</li>

<li><tt>/sys/bus/usb/devices/*/serial</tt>: Serial numbers of various USB
devices, as encoded in the USB device EEPROM. Most devices don't have a serial
number set, and if they have it is often bogus. If the user replaces his USB
hardware or plugs it into another machine these IDs may change or appear in
other machines. This hence too is of little use.</li>

</ol>

<p>There are various other hardware IDs available, many of which you may
discover via the ID_SERIAL udev property of various devices, such hard disks
and similar. They all have in common that they are bound to specific
(replacable) hardware, not universally available, often filled with bogus data
and random in virtualized environments. Or in other words: don't use them, don't
rely on them for identification, unless you really know what you are doing and
in general they do not guarantee what you might hope they guarantee.</p>

<h4>Software IDs</h4>

<ol>

<li><tt>/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id</tt>: A random ID that is regenerated
on each boot. As such it can be used to identify the local machine's current
boot. It's universally available on any recent Linux kernel. It's a good and
safe choice if you need to identify a specific boot on a specific booted
kernel.</li>

<li><tt>gethostname()</tt>, <tt>/proc/sys/kernel/hostname</tt>: A non-random ID
configured by the administrator to identify a machine in the network. Often
this is not set at all or is set to some default value such as
<tt>localhost</tt> and not even unique in the local network. In addition it
might change during runtime, for example because it changes based on updated
DHCP information. As such it is almost entirely useless for anything but
presentation to the user. It has very weak semantics and relies on correct
configuration by the administrator. Don't use this to identify machines in a
distributed environment. It won't work unless centrally administered, which
makes it useless in a globalized, mobile world. It has no place in
automatically generated filenames that shall be bound to specific hosts. Just
don't use it, please. It's really not what many people think it is.
<tt>gethostname()</tt> is standardized in POSIX and hence portable to other
Unixes.</li>

<li>IP Addresses returned by SIOCGIFCONF or the respective Netlink APIs: These
tend to be dynamically assigned and often enough only valid on local networks
or even only the local links (i.e. 192.168.x.x style addresses, or even
169.254.x.x/IPv4LL). Unfortunately they hence have little use outside of
networking.</li>

<li><tt>gethostid()</tt>: Returns a supposedly unique 32-bit identifier for the
current machine. The semantics of this is not clear. On most machines this
simply returns a value based on a local IPv4 address. On others it is
administrator controlled via the <tt>/etc/hostid</tt> file. Since the semantics
of this ID are not clear and most often is just a value based on the IP address it is
almost always the wrong choice to use. On top of that 32bit are not
particularly a lot. On the other hand this is standardized in POSIX and hence
portable to other Unixes. It's probably best to ignore this value and if people
don't want to ignore it they should probably symlink <tt>/etc/hostid</tt> to
<tt>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</tt> or something similar.</li>

<li><tt>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</tt>: An ID identifying a specific Linux/Unix
installation. It does not change if hardware is replaced. It is not unreliable
in virtualized environments. This value has clear semantics and is considered
part of the D-Bus API. It is supposedly globally unique and portable to all
systems that have D-Bus. On Linux, it is universally available, given that
almost all non-embedded and even a fair share of the embedded machines ship
D-Bus now.  This is the recommended way to identify a machine, possibly with a
fallback to the host name to cover systems that still lack D-Bus. If your
application links against <tt>libdbus</tt>, you may access this ID with
<tt>dbus_get_local_machine_id()</tt>, if not you can read it directly from the file system.</li>

<li><tt>/proc/self/sessionid</tt>: An ID identifying a specific Linux login
session. This ID is maintained by the kernel and part of the auditing logic. It
is uniquely assigned to each login session during a specific system boot,
shared by each process of a session, even across su/sudo and cannot be changed
by userspace. Unfortunately some distributions have so far failed to set things
up properly for this to work (Hey, you, Ubuntu!), and this ID is always
<tt>(uint32_t) -1</tt> for them. But there's hope they get this fixed
eventually. Nonetheless it is a good choice for a unique session identifier on
the local machine and for the current boot. To make this ID globally unique it
is best combined with <tt>/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id</tt>.</li>

<li><tt>getuid()</tt>: An ID identifying a specific Unix/Linux user. This ID is
usually automatically assigned when a user is created. It is not unique across
machines and may be reassigned to a different user if the original user was
deleted. As such it should be used only locally and with the limited validity
in time in mind. To make this ID globally unique it is not sufficient to
combine it with <tt>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</tt>, because the same ID might be
used for a different user that is created later with the same UID. Nonetheless
this combination is often good enough. It is available on all POSIX systems.</li>

<li><tt>ID_FS_UUID</tt>: an ID that identifies a specific file system in the
udev tree. It is not always clear how these serials are generated but this
tends to be available on almost all modern disk file systems. It is not
available for NFS mounts or virtual file systems. Nonetheless this is often a
good way to identify a file system, and in the case of the root directory even
an installation. However due to the weakly defined generation semantics the
D-Bus machine ID is generally preferrable.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Generating IDs</h4>

<p>Linux offers a kernel interface to generate UUIDs on demand, by reading from
<tt>/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid</tt>. This is a very simple interface to
generate UUIDs. That said, the logic behind UUIDs is unnecessarily complex and
often it is a better choice to simply read 16 bytes or so from
<tt>/dev/urandom</tt>.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>And the gist of it all: <b>Use <tt>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</tt>! Use
<tt>/proc/self/sessionid</tt>! Use <tt>/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id</tt>!
Use <tt>getuid()</tt>! Use <tt>/dev/urandom</tt>!</b> And forget about the
rest, in particular the host name, or the hardware IDs such as DMI. And keep in
mind that you may combine the aforementioned IDs in various ways to get
different semantics and validity constraints.</p></div>

What it shows is the relative performance of using the X server compared to just using the computer\u2019s CPU for rendering the real-world benchmarks we Cairo people compiled. The red bar in the center is the time the CPU renderer takes. If the bar goes to the left, using the X server is slower, if it goes to the right, using the X server is faster. Colors represent the different computers the benchmark ran on (see the legend on the left side), and the numbers tell you how much slower or faster the test ran. So the first number \u201c-3.5\u2033 means that the test ran 3.5x slower using the X server than it ran just using the CPU. And the graph shows very impressively that the GPU is somewhere between 13 times slower and 5 times faster than the CPU depending on the task you do. And even for the exact same task, it can be between 7 times slower and 2 times faster depending on the computer it\u2019s running on. So should you use the GPU for what you do?\n</p><p>\n<b>Well, what\u2019s actually benchmarked here?</b>\n</p><p>\nThe benchmarks are so-called traces recorded using <code>cairo-trace APPLICATION</code>. This tool will be available with Cairo 1.10. It works a bit like <code>strace</code> in that it intercepts all cairo calls of your application. It then records them to a file and that file can later be played back for benchmarking rendering performance. We\u2019ve so far taken various test cases we considered important and added them to <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/cairo-traces">our test-suite</a>. They contain everything from watching a Video on Youtube (swfdec-youtube) over running <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos">Mozilla\u2019s Talos testsuite</a> to scrolling in gnome-terminal. The <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/cairo-traces/tree/README">cairo-traces README</a> explains them all. The README also explains how to contribute traces. And we\u2019d love to have more useful traces.\n</p><p>\n<b>But GL!</b>\n</p><p>\nYes, OpenGL is apparently <a href="http://lightspark.sourceforge.net/">the solution to all problems</a> with rendering performance. Which is why I worked hard in recent weeks to improve Cairo\u2019s GL backend.  The same graph as above, just using GL instead of Xlib looks like this:<br />\n<img src="http://blogs.gnome.org/otte/files/2010/06/intel-gl-comparison.png" alt="comparison graph for gl on intel" title="intel-gl-comparison" /><br />\nWhat do we learn? Yes, it\u2019s equally confusing, from 30 times slower to 3 times faster. And we have twice as fast and 1.5x slower on the same test depending on hardware. So it\u2019s the same mess all over again. We cannot even say if using the CPU is better or worse than using the GPU on the same machine. Take the EeePC results for the firefox-planet-gnome test: Xlib 2.5x faster, GL is 4.5x slower. Yay.\n</p><p>\n<b>But that\u2019s only Intel graphics</b>\n</p><p>\nYeah, we\u2019re all working on Intel chips in Cairo development. Which might be related to the fact that we all either work for Intel or get laptops with Intel GPUs. Fortunately, Chris had a Netbook with an nvidia chip where he ran the tests on \u2013 once with the nvidia binary driver and once with the Open Source <a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/">nouveau driver</a>. Here\u2019s the Xlib results:<br />\n<img src="http://blogs.gnome.org/otte/files/2010/06/nvidia-xlib-comparison.png" alt="comparison graph for xlib on nvidia" title="nvidia-xlib-comparison" /><br />\nRight, that looks as unconclusive as before. Maybe a tad worse than on Intel machines. And nouveau seems to be faster than the binary nvidia driver. Good work! But surely for GL nvidia GPUs will rule the world, in particular with the nvidia binary driver. Let\u2019s have a look:<br />\n<img src="http://blogs.gnome.org/otte/files/2010/06/nvidia-gl-comparison.png" alt="comparison graph for gl on nvidia" title="nvidia-gl-comparison" /><br />\nImpressive, isn\u2019t it? GL on nvidia is slow. There\u2019s not a single test where using the CPU would be noticably slower. And this is on a Netbook, where CPUs are slow. And the common knowledge that the binary drivers are better than nouveau aren\u2019t true either: nouveau is significantly better. But then, we had a good laugh because we convinced ourselves that Intel GPUs seem to be a far better choice than nVidia GPUs currently.\n</p><p>\n<b>That\u2019s not enough data!</b>\n</p><p>\nNow here\u2019s the problem: To have a really really good laugh, we need to be sure that Intel is better than nVidia and ATI. And we don\u2019t have enough data points to prove that conclusively yet. So if you have a bunch of spare CPU cycles and are not scared of building development code, you could run these benchmarks on your machine and send them to me. That way, you help the Cairo team getting a better overview of where we stand and a good idea of what areas need improvement the most. Here\u2019s what you need to do:\n</p><ol>\n<li>Make sure your distro is up to date. Recent releases \u2013 like Fedora 13 or Ubuntu Lucid \u2013 are necessary. If you run development trees of everything, that\u2019s even better.\n</li><li>Start downloading <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~company/stuff/cairo-traces.tar.bz2">http://people.freedesktop.org/~company/stuff/cairo-traces.tar.bz2</a> \u2013 it\u2019s a 103MB file that contains the benchmark traces from <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/cairo-traces">the cairo-traces repository</a>.\n</li><li>Install the development backages required to build Cairo. There\u2019s commands like <code>apt-get build-dep cairo</code> or <code>yum-builddep cairo</code> that do that.\n</li><li>Install development packages for OpenGL.\n</li><li>Check out current Cairo from git using <code>git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/cairo</code>\n</li><li>Run <code>./autogen.sh --enable-gl</code> in the checked out cairo dir. In the summary output at the end, ensure that the Xlib and the GL backends will be built.\n</li><li>Run <code>make</code>\n</li><li>change into the perf/ directory.\n</li><li>Run <code>make cairo-perf-trace</code>\n</li><li>Unpack the cairo-traces.tar.bz2 that hopefully finished downloading by now using <code>tar xjf cairo-traces.tar.bz2</code>. This will create a benchmark directory containing the traces.\n</li><li>Run <code>CAIRO_TEST_TARGET=image,xlib,gl ./cairo-perf-trace -r -v -i3 benchmark/* &gt; `git describe`-`date \'+%Y%m%d\'`.`hostname`.perf</code>. Ideally, you don\u2019t want to use the computer while the benchmark runs. It will output statistics to the terminal while it runs and generate a .perf file, named something like \u201c1.9.8-56-g1373675-20100624.lvs.perf\u201d.\n</li><li>Attach the file into an email and send it to <a href="mailto:otte@gnome.org">otte@gnome.org</a>, preferrably with information on your CPU, GPU and which distribution and drivers you were running the test on.</li></ol>\n<p>Note: The test runs will take a while. Depending on your drivers and CPU, it\u2019ll take between 15 minutes and a day \u2013 it takes ~half an hour on my 6months old X200 laptop.\n</p><p>\n<b>What\u2019s going to happen with all the benchmarks?</b>\n</p><p>\nDepending on the feedback I get for this, I intend to either weep into a pillow because noone took the time to run the benchmarks, write another blog post with pretty graphics or even do a presentation about it at Linux conferences. Because most of all I intend to make us developers learn from it so that we can improve drivers and libraries so that the tests are 10x faster when you upgrade your distro the next time.\n</p><p>\n<small>Note: I originally read the nvidia graph wrong and assumed the binary drivers were faster for OpenGL. I double-checked my data: This is not true. nouveau is faster for the Cairo workloads than the nvidia driver.</small></p></div>', 'language': u'en'}], 'source': {'updated': u'2010-06-28T10:25:00Z', 'subtitle': u'Swfdec, GStreamer, Cairo, GNOME, me', 'updated_parsed': (2010, 6, 28, 10, 25, 0, 0, 179, 0), 'links': [{'href': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/otte/feed/', 'type': u'application/rss+xml', 'rel': u'self'}, {'href': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/otte', 'type': u'text/html', 'rel': u'alternate'}], 'title': u'Swfblag', 'subtitle_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'Swfdec, GStreamer, Cairo, GNOME, me'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'Swfblag'}, 'link': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/otte', 'id': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/otte'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'value': u'fun with benchmarks', 'language': u'en'}, 'link': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/otte/2010/06/26/fun-with-benchmarks/', 'author': u'Benjamin Otte', 'author_detail': {'name': u'Benjamin Otte'}, 'id': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/otte/?p=278'}

Entry title: GSoC Weekly Code Report 5
Entry link: http://axsaprykin.blogspot.com/2010/06/gsoc-weekly-code-report-5.html
Entry description: <div>It has been a month gone since the start of GSoC coding... The time is running too fast. I've done my last exam in university, and now I'm waiting for a practice, but it will be a bit later. Last weekends I was at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petergof">Petergof</a>, a very beautiful and amazing suburb near the St. Petersburg. Though it was full of tourists and visitors, I had a good free time :) Also I re-installed my Debian and Fedora systems due to bad performance of the file system (reiser 3.6, had been heavy used for 2.5 years). Spent some time to get compiled fresh GTK+ and friends. Well, back to GSoC. I planned to read GStreamer documentation last week. But half of the time I was busy with my chapters plugin. My mentor Bastien Nocera reviewed all my work done before, so I was fixing issues and implementing some features:<br /><ul><li>read GStreamer documentation: full Application Developer Manual and a half of a Plugin's Writer Manual. Not bad, I think, but I need to finish them this week;</li><br /><li>reported to bugzilla some typos found during documentation reading;</li><br /><li>couple of days ago Totem was ported to libpeas to use it for plugin handling, so I read related docs and ported chapters plugin to libpeas. It was really easy to do it ;)</li><br /><li>cleaned up code a bit, fixed some style issues and fixed bugs/memory leaks found. Thanks to Bastien for reviewing my code;</li><br /><li>made first steps to integrate plugin into the Totem: now preferences window has option to auto-load chapters:<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Taza3Z9Pt44/TCUXNQjs1zI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/ET5H5ggTSRc/s1600/totem1.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Taza3Z9Pt44/TCUXNQjs1zI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/ET5H5ggTSRc/s320/totem1.png" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5486817237571262258" alt="" /></a><br />Well, screenshots are ugly a bit because of building Totem with GTK+-3 (2.90.x version), and I haven't tuned themes yet for it;</li><br /><li>now after Totem's launch chapters plugin looks like this:<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Taza3Z9Pt44/TCUYO1FlItI/AAAAAAAAAEY/hA9GeFajRUk/s1600/totem2.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Taza3Z9Pt44/TCUYO1FlItI/AAAAAAAAAEY/hA9GeFajRUk/s320/totem2.png" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5486818364068537042" alt="" /></a><br />There is no empty list with buttons anymore if no movie is loaded, and it looks more cleaner. Also you can load chapters from any external file (if auto-load is disabled, or no file with chapters was found). Here is a chapters plugin screenshot after loading movie without chapters data:<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Taza3Z9Pt44/TCUanKVMjqI/AAAAAAAAAEg/-BUF6qfgwqY/s1600/totem3.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Taza3Z9Pt44/TCUanKVMjqI/AAAAAAAAAEg/-BUF6qfgwqY/s320/totem3.png" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5486820981111295650" alt="" /></a><br />Well, I'm not sure about buttons' position... Maybe it's better to move them bottom? Any feedback is welcomed. So, here you have two ways to go: to load chapters from existing file or to add them manually from scratch while watching the movie. I also removed holes from pixbufs;</li><br /><li>made some minor fixes/improvements.</li></ul>That's it. I've done almost all that I was planning last week. Only I need to do is to finish GStreamer documentation reading (hope to do it these weekends or at the begining of the week). But I made some progress with my plugin, and that's a nice surprise :) Totem 2.90.0 was just released, so you can test it along with chapters plugin. I synced my repository with Totem's master, so you can find where to grab the fresh version on my <a href="http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2010/AlexanderSaprykin_Totem">portfolio page</a>. Next week I want to start to design generic chapters interface for GStreamer after I'll finish reading all the docs.

A run of <code>make distcheck</code> escalates the problem, because all files during a <code>dist</code> need to be rebuilt. Small errors triggered late in the <code>dist</code> build might require several time consuming restarts of the build process. </p>\n<p> \n</p><p align="left"> With <strong>ccache</strong>, a tool exists that can majorly speed up this process. I\u2019ve been using it successfully for several years now. A related development aid is <strong>colorgcc</strong> which is a colorization wrapper for gcc. This also is under heavy use for my development. It turns out that some tweaks are needed to get it working together with ccache though. </p>\n<p> \n</p><p align="left"> Here\u2019s how to use the tools in combination to speed up regular project builds and also <code>distcheck</code>: </p>\n<ul type="square">\n<li> Get and install <a href="http://ccache.samba.org/"> ccache</a>. <br /> Wrapping compiler invocations with ccache will cache recompilations of the same units. ccache needs a directory to store the cache contents; this defaults to <code>/tmp</code> which is usually cleaned upon reboots. So I\u2019d recommend to put this into your <code>.bashrc</code>:\n<pre>export CCACHE_DIR="/var/tmp/ccache-$USER"\n</pre>\n<p> This will retain the compiler cache across reboots in <code>/var/tmp</code>. </p></li>\n<li> Get and install <a href="http://github.com/johannes/colorgcc"> colorgcc</a>. <br /> Then some patching is in order, especially if you use multiple versions of gcc and need ccache integration. Based on colorgcc from Ubuntu-9.10, I\u2019ve prepared a patch for this (it has been sent to Jamie Moyers some while ago) to be found here: <a href="http://testbit.eu/~timj/blogstuff/xyv-colorgcc.diff">http://testbit.eu/~timj/blogstuff/xyv-colorgcc.diff</a>\n<p> To briefly summarize its effects:\n</p><ul type="disc">\n<li> This allows colorgcc to be used through a bunch of links, e.g. by creating:\n<pre>ln -s colorgcc colorg++\nln -s colorgcc colorgcc-4.4\nln -s colorgcc colorg++-4.4\n</pre>\n<p> Invoking the script through those links will cause it to strip the \u2018^color\u2019 prefix and invoke the respective compiler. </p></li>\n<li> Using this patch, <code>/usr/bin/ccache</code> will be used to wrap the compiler invocation if it exists. </li>\n<li> The patch also contains some UTF-8 quotation fixes needed for gcc-4.4 support. </li>\n<li> Finally, the patch enables colorgcc to correctly deal with g++ error message that span multiple lines (e.g. template error messages). </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Use colorgcc as a compiler replacement for project builds:\n<pre>rm -f config.cache\n./autogen.sh CC=colorgcc-4.4 CXX=colorg++-4.4\nnice make all -j4\n</pre>\n</li>\n<li> Use colorgcc as a compiler replacement for <code>distcheck</code> builds:\n<pre>CC=colorgcc CXX=colorg++ nice make all distcheck\n</pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> \n</p><p align="left"> Finally, you might want to tweak the colors of colorgcc\u2019s output which can be adjusted in <code>/etc/colorgcc/colorgccrc</code>.

You know when it\u2019s there and you know when it\u2019s not.\xa0<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maceo_Parker">Maceo Parker</a>, a groove maven, usually starts his concerts with something like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We\u2019d like to present 2% Jazz and 98% funky stuff. This is known as happy music. Happy music is when you hear it, you start moving and shaking something automatically!</p></blockquote>\n<p>I love groovy music. But I have especial preference for more raw grooves. By raw\xa0I mean the grooves that are powerful because they are imperfect, human, noisy and full of energy. Grooves are becoming too synthetic, metronomic,\xa0clean, and perfect nowadays. They often lose the point. So, here\u2019s a quick list of some of the raw groovy tunes I love.</p>\n<p><strong>Sex Machine by James Brown.</strong> Yes, the classic one. It\u2019s full of energy and has a tight groove. Great example of use space between bass, guitar, and drums.</p>\n<p><strong>Shake Everything You\u2019ve Got by</strong><strong> Maceo Parker.</strong> He is one of the most prominent disciples of the James Brown \u201cuniversity\u201d \u2013 as he usually says. This song is all about enjoying the moment. My favourite version is in the album <em>Life on Planet Groove</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Rocks by</strong><strong> Brecker Brothers.</strong> They are a great jazz fusion\xa0duo \u2013 Michael on sax and Rangy on trumpet. I first heard <em>Rocks </em>in one of the 5 Brecker Brothers albums I bought last year. The groove arises from the alternation of bass and guitar lines on top of a powerful drum beat.</p>\n<p><strong>Cissy Strut by</strong><strong> The Meters.</strong> This is a classic groove \u2013 for those into funky stuff. <em>C</em><em>issy Strut</em> is a slow-tempo funky song. Great use of space, packed with swing. The drum beat is simply awesome!</p>\n<p><strong>Serpentine Fire by</strong><strong> Earth Wind &amp; Fire.</strong> Ok, it\u2019s quite hard to pick only one tune from those guys. They have a countless number of amazing groovy songs. Serpentine Fire has such a great vibe. Maurice White delivers a great singing performance, packed with energy.</p>\n<p>As I said, this is just quick list. Groove is everywhere and, because it\u2019s a subjective thing, people tend to have different favourite artists groove-wise. What are your favourite raw grooves?</p></div>', 'language': u'en'}], 'source': {'updated': u'2010-06-25T13:26:59Z', 'subtitle': u'The mustache, the beard and the smile: everything together.', 'updated_parsed': (2010, 6, 25, 13, 26, 59, 4, 176, 0), 'links': [{'href': u'http://lucasr.org/tag/planet-gnome/feed/', 'type': u'application/rss+xml', 'rel': u'self'}, {'href': u'http://lucasr.org', 'type': u'text/html', 'rel': u'alternate'}], 'title': u'lucasr.at.mundo \xbb planet', 'subtitle_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'The mustache, the beard and the smile: everything together.'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'lucasr.at.mundo \xbb planet'}, 'link': u'http://lucasr.org', 'id': u'http://lucasr.org'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'value': u'Raw Grooves', 'language': u'en'}, 'link': u'http://lucasr.org/2010/06/25/raw-grooves/', 'author': u'Lucas Rocha', 'author_detail': {'name': u'Lucas Rocha'}, 'id': u'http://lucasr.org/?p=1396'}

We need to advance at the practical level and at the philosophical level.</div>\n<div>GNOME is good free software, and thus contributes at the practical level. How will candidates use the user community\u2019s awareness of GNOME to contribute to educating the communityn about freedom?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>At a stretch the question is similar in theme to the questions/concerns around GNOME and Free Software ideals that come up from time to time. I recall reading similar questions during earlier elections and, it isn\u2019t specifically new or, something that has come out of the blue.</div>\n<div>I came to know of the <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HQGY6TJ">survey</a> when I read the<a href="http://identi.ca/notice/37183046"> micro-blog</a> from <a href="http://identi.ca/lefty">Lefty</a>. And, then we had a bit of <a href="http://identi.ca/conversation/36968024#notice-37183508">conversation</a>.</div>\n<div>Personally, I don\u2019t feel comfortable about the survey.</div>\n<div>The line of reasoning is as follows \u2013 as a member of the GNOME Foundation one has the right to express one\u2019s opinion about the direction and focus of the Foundation by supporting the appropriate (set of) candidate(s). From the perspective of a Foundation it is perfectly valid to focus on areas which are aligned with the very reason for the Foundation and the project to exist. In fact, focussing only on those areas wouldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be taken amiss. In short, the Foundation can choose to exercise what it should work on in the near or long term future or, it shouldn\u2019t. As long as such goals and tasks do not appear to be detrimental to the cause of Free and Open Source Software things should work out nicely.</div>\n<div>I hasten to add that similar should be the focus of the Free Software Foundation as well. The survey attempts to somewhat codify this implicit responsibility areas and, I do get the feeling that the specific question</div>\n<blockquote><div>\u201cIn what way would you ordinarily refer to \u201can operating system based on a Linux kernel and using mainstream, mainly community-developed components and applications\u201d? (Distributions representing such include Debian, Gentoo, Fedora, Open SuSE, etc. Android does not qualify, nor does WebOS, etc.)\u201d</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>is implicitly divisive. An \u201cus/them\u201d meme that has been festering on the foundation-list for a while now.</div>\n<div>I did not participate in the survey. I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019d rather like GNOME to focus on being an excellent desktop environment with strong technical and technology focus going back to the times when I started using it as my primary desktop. The Board needs to work out its focus and, work on the project\u2019s future with much more rigor than it does now. To me the survey is just a passing distraction.

This one still needs a little work, as I\u2019ve started working on it yesterday, but it will be ready and tested for next week. The synchronization engine, which is common for all backends (and generic, as the only requirements it has is that objects it syncs have unique id and a modification date), really does most of the work.</p>\n<p>As usual, a screenshot with the Launchpad backend at work:</p>\n<p><a href="http://allievi.sssup.it/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screenshot-11.png"><img src="http://allievi.sssup.it/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screenshot-11.png" title="Screenshot-1" height="403" width="507" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-413" /></a></p>\n<p>Next week I\u2019ll work a little less, as I have my \u201cpre-degree\u201d exam.

Entry link: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/sssuptech/~3/PT6DR9tMfvM/
Entry description: Another GSoC week has gone, and my project with “Getting Things Gnome!” has moved forward. We now have a complete tomboy backend. Tomboy notes matching a particular @tag (you can configure multiple tags, or get all notes) are imported in GTG. The synchronization is both ways: if you change  something in Tomboy, GTG will be updated [...]

<p>As I mentioned in the part 1 (above link) working with databases is not just about having a good place to store data, without a good and simple API to access the stored data we would have a sealed box full of information that we just can't use. Nowadays, there are many tools that make data-access process easier, for example, there are frameworks (like Django) that have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORMs</a> that, as Wikipedia article says, <i>"create <strong>virtual object databases</strong> that can be used from within the programming language".</i> Ok, all this is great but: </p>
<h4>How do we know that a database has a good API?</h4>

<p>This might sound like personal opinion but, I'm sure we all agree with most of the things listed bellow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The less methods the better</strong>: It's a waste of code and time when APIs need to instantiate N objects (excluding connections objects) before being able to execute a simple query, come on, that process could be simplified with a single call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The fastest the better</strong>: If the above point is a waste of time, this one is even worse. There are queries that may take some seconds before returning the results, we can accept that, obviously, It depends on the query but, if the 40% / 50% of that delay is caused by the driver you should definitely find a better one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comunication Methods matter</strong>: There are many communication protocols and methods so I'm not going to list them here but, you have to be aware that some of them may be faster than others so before saying that the communication method exposed by the API is good take a look to the next point and be sure that it fits your needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speed Tests</strong>: Benchmarking is always great and there are thousands of benchmarks around the net so, go to your favourite search engine and start looking for benchmarks related to the database that you're interested in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Now what?</h4>

<p>We now know that API is important and that it must be simple and fast, even though, that's not enough. A good API is also versatile and not app oriented, for example, If my database API is oriented to Web Applications then I'm doing something wrong because any kind of application has to be able to use that API to access my database unless the database itself is oriented to web applications (which would be really weird). That said, we should take a deeper look to what web applications need to be developed in short time and without affecting their performance.

Entry description: <div>I've had the opportunity to look into the <a href="http://thejoojoo.com">Joojoo</a> tablet recently. It's an interesting device in various ways, ranging from the screen being connected upside down and everything having to be rotated before display, to the ACPI implementation that's so generic it has no support for actually attaching most embedded controller interrupts to ACPI devices and so relies on a hacked kernel that exposes individual interrupts as ACPI events that are parsed in userspace, to the ChangeOrientation binary that's responsible for switching between landscape and portrait modes containing gems like <tt>ps aux | grep fgplayer | grep -v grep</tt> and containing references to <tt>org.freedesktop.PandaSystem</tt>, a somewhat gratuitous namespace grab. Hardware-wise it seems to be little more than battery, generic nvidia reference design board and touchscreen with an accelerometer and LED glued to the chipset's GPIO lines. The entire impression is one of an ambitious project not backed up by the level of technical expertise required to get things done properly.

As a starting point we will port some open source echo cancellation implementations to this framework, with one of them ending up as the default (the goal is that applications can just ask for the default, but that they can also ask for a specific one if it doesn\u2019t want the default for some reason).</p>\n<p>We hope this work will have a lot of positive long term effects, easier support for echo cancellation in applications, new improved echo cancellation algorithms and implementations being released and improved audio drivers on the linux desktop (not all drivers are doing a good job currently).</p>\n<p>So in the coming weeks Wim Taymans will be leading this effort on our side and I will try to keep you up to date on it as it progresses. </p>\n<p>So a big thanks to NLnet for making this possible. </p></div>', 'language': u'en'}], 'source': {'updated': u'2010-06-28T10:08:20Z', 'subtitle': u'GStreamer and Collabora news and more', 'updated_parsed': (2010, 6, 28, 10, 8, 20, 0, 179, 0), 'links': [{'href': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/feed/', 'type': u'application/rss+xml', 'rel': u'self'}, {'href': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus', 'type': u'text/html', 'rel': u'alternate'}], 'title': u'Christian Schaller', 'subtitle_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'GStreamer and Collabora news and more'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'Christian Schaller'}, 'link': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus', 'id': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'value': u'NLNet, Collabora Multimedia and Echo Cancellation', 'language': u'en'}, 'link': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2010/06/24/nlnet-collabora-multimedia-and-echo-cancellation/', 'author': u'uraeus', 'author_detail': {'name': u'uraeus'}, 'id': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/?p=1343'}

Also, when adding a new folder, it doesn\u2019t show up on the list if you don\u2019t restart Cryptkeeper.

Or said in other words; how to create a good mobile web view that can be used on touch devices.</p><p>First we should make it clear that QGraphicsWebView is the way forward, so if you want to target mobile devices, it is bye bye QWebView. Why is that? Well, the QWebView is based on the QWidget system, thus it cannot easily support rotation, overlays, hardware accelerated compositing and tiling. If you need a QWidget anyway, you can always construct a QGraphicsView (which is a QWidget) with a QGraphicsWebView inside. This is more or less what we will start with.</p><p>Let\'s start with the most simple QGraphicsWebView based "browser" ever:</p><pre class="wiki">int main(int argc, char **argv)<br />{<br />   QApplication app(argc, argv);<br />   const int width = 640;<br />   const int height = 480;<br /><br />   QGraphicsScene scene;<br /><br />   QGraphicsView view(&amp;scene);<br />   view.setFrameShape(QFrame::NoFrame);<br />   view.setVerticalScrollBarPolicy(Qt::ScrollBarAlwaysOff);<br />   view.setHorizontalScrollBarPolicy(Qt::ScrollBarAlwaysOff);<br /><br />   QGraphicsWebView webview;<br />   webview.resize(width, height);<br />   webview.load(QUrl("http://www.wouwlabs.com/blogs/jeez"));<br /><br />   scene.addItem(&amp;webview);<br />   view.resize(width, height);<br />   view.show();<br /><br />   return app.exec();<br />}</pre><p>Here we just bootstrap a QGraphicsView application and add a QGraphicsWebView to the scene.</p><p>It might seem a bit useless as you can only navigate through one website, but it serves well as a simple example. Notice that I\'m disabling the scrollbars on the graphics view because <a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/QtWebKit" class="wiki">QtWebKit</a> handles scrolling and scrollbars automatically. This is due to scrolling optimizations and due to the fact that web authors can interact with the scrollbars for instance style them differently.</p><p>On touch-based mobile devices a feature known as tiling is often used. It is used due to the interaction model (touch) as well as a scrolling "optimization". With this optimization we will have to deal with scrolling ourselves and we thus will have to say good bye to the scrollbar styling. Not a big thing, as mobile browsers usually do not even show scrollbars, but use scroll indicators instead.</p><p>Tiling basically means that the contents of the viewport is separated into a grid of tiles, so that when you update some area, instead of just updating the area you actually update the whole tile. This gives a few advantages for scrolling as when you scroll you do not need to repaint the new visible area for each scroll step, as you update a row of tiles each time; tiles that are often only partly on the screen. This minimized all the paint calls that we have to do and makes it possible to make nicely kinetic scrolling a possibility.</p><p>Loading, layouting etc are blocking operations. Though barely noticeable on a Desktop machines, these operations can block for a long time on a mobile device, letting the user believe the application has become unresponsive and died. Scrolling which is done by using fingers will also stall and give a bad user experience.</p><p>One way to over come this issue, is to do all loading, layouting and painting (basically all non-UI related work) in another thread or process, and just blit the result from the web process/thread to the UI. When using tiles, you can blit any tile available when scrolling. When no tile is available you can show a checkerboard tile instead, not letting the scrolling wait for the tiles to be updated. This results in a responsive interface, with the only disadvantage that you from time to time might see checkerboard tiles.</p><p>Tiles also helps with zooming. Repainting at each zoom level change during a zoom animation is basically impossible on a mobile device (or desktop for that sake) and thus with tiling, you can stop the tiles from being updates and just scale the already existing tiles, and then at the end of the animation update tiles on top of the scaled ones.</p><p>For now we will ignore the blocking issue and concentrate on the tiling and the interaction model.</p><p><br /></p><h3 id="Resizetocontents">Resize to contents<a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=36235783#Resizetocontents" class="anchor" title="Link to this section"></a></h3><p>When using tiling, we basically want the QGraphicsWebView to act as our contents, as it supports tiling a.o. things.

In particular the width is larger than the width of the device!</p><p>The way web contents is laid out, is that the first the viewport width is used for fitting the contents. If the contents doesn\'t fit due to non-flexible element with a width larger than the viewport width, the min width possible will be used. As most pages are written with a desktop browser in mind, that makes only very few sites fit into the width of a mobile device.</p><p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/QtWebKit" class="wiki">QtWebKit</a> has a way to force a layout to a given width/height. What really matters here is the width. If you layout a size to a given width, it will get that width and images etc might get cut of. The width/height is also used for laying out fixed elements, but when we resize the QGraphicsWebView to the size of the contents, fixed elements will not be relative to the view, which is the behaviour found on most mobile browsers.</p><p>From <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qwebpage.html#preferredContentsSize-prop" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"> </span>Qt 4.7 documentation</a>: "If this property is set to a valid size, it is used to lay out the page."</p><p>We saw that this property is automatically set to a reasonable value when using QGraphicsWebView::resizesToContents.</p><p>As you can imaging, laying out with a smaller viewport can cause pages to break, and as thus, a default value has been chosen so that it almost breaks no pages while still making the sites fit. This value is 960x800.</p><p>If the device have a bigger resolution, this value can be changed using:</p><pre class="wiki">    webview.page()-&gt;setPreferredContentsSize(QSize(desiredWidth, desiredHeight)); </pre><p>You can play around with this and find your own magic number, but let\'s stick to this 960px wide for now.</p><p><br /></p><h3 id="Theviewportmetatag">The \'viewport\' meta tag<a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=36235783#Theviewportmetatag" class="anchor" title="Link to this section"></a></h3><p>As some sites do not work with 960 or want to have control on how the page is laid out, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/QtWebKit" class="wiki">QtWebKit</a> as well as Android, Firefox Mobile and the iPhone Safari supports a meta tag called viewport.</p><p>This one also deserves a whole blog post for itself. For now let\'s just say that this is a meta tag that Apple came up with to make a web page capable of "telling" the browser how it wants to be shown.</p><p>More information: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/appleapplications/reference/safarihtmlref/articles/metatags.html" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"> </span>http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/appleapplications/reference/safarihtmlref/articles/metatags.html</a> and<a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/appleapplications/reference/safariwebcontent/usingtheviewport/usingtheviewport.html" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"> </span>http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/appleapplications/reference/safariwebcontent/usingtheviewport/usingtheviewport.html</a></p><p>In <a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/QtWebKit" class="wiki">QtWebKit</a> trunk we already have support for this with a nice API. You must connect the signal from QWebPage::viewportChangeRequested(const ViewportHints&amp; hints) to a slot of your mobile web view and use what is provided by QWebPage::ViewportHints to updated your viewport size, scale range, and so on.</p><p>This can be tricky and that\'s why I\'m not going deeper on it right now. Since I know you are curious about it I\'ll leave you with one more exercise! So try to understand how the guys from MicroB and Firefox Mobile dealt with this:</p><p><a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/05/upcoming-changes-to-the-viewport-meta-tag-for-firefox-mobile" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"> </span>http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/05/upcoming-changes-to-the-viewport-meta-tag-for-firefox-mobile</a></p><p><br /></p><h3 id="Enablingthetiling">Enabling the tiling<a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=36235783#EnablingtheTiling" class="anchor" title="Link to this section"></a></h3><p>We haven\'t actually enabled tiling yet, so lets go ahead and do that. That is very simple as it is basically a setting:</p><pre class="wiki">    QWebSettings::globalSettings()-&gt;setAttribute(QWebSettings::TiledBackingStoreEnabled, true); </pre><p>Voila! Mind that if you are going to add animations to your zoom/scale or want to implement a fancy kinetic scrolling you might want to take a look at QGraphicsWebView::setTiledBackingStoreFrozen. With this you can avoid updates to your tiles during an animation, for instance.</p><p><br /></p><h3 id="Avoidingscrollablesubelements">Avoiding scrollable sub elements<a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=36235783#Avoidingscrollablesubelements" class="anchor" title="Link to this section"></a></h3><p>One big issue with the above is that, iframes and sites using frames can contain scrollable sub elements. That doesn\'t work well with the touch interaction model, as you want a finger swipe to scroll the whole page and not end up just scrolling a sub frame. Most mobile browser work around this by enabling something called frame flattening.</p><p>Going straight to the point:</p><pre class="wiki">    QWebSettings::globalSettings()-&gt;setAttribute(QWebSettings::FrameFlatteningEnable, true); </pre><p>This will make all frames from a web page expand themselves to the size of their contents, keeping us free of scrollable subareas.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36235783-6935337900480281360?l=codeposts.blogspot.com" alt="" height="1" width="1" /></div></div>', 'updated_parsed': (2010, 6, 23, 14, 24, 0, 2, 174, 0), 'links': [{'href': u'http://codeposts.blogspot.com/feeds/6935337900480281360/comments/default', 'type': u'application/atom+xml', 'rel': u'replies', 'title': u'Post Comments'}, {'href': u'https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36235783&postID=6935337900480281360', 'type': u'text/html', 'rel': u'replies', 'title': u'3 Comments'}, {'href': u'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36235783/posts/default/6935337900480281360', 'type': u'application/atom+xml', 'rel': u'edit'}, {'href': u'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36235783/posts/default/6935337900480281360', 'type': u'application/atom+xml', 'rel': u'self'}, {'href': u'http://codeposts.blogspot.com/2010/06/qtwebkit-goes-mobile.html', 'type': u'text/html', 'rel': u'alternate', 'title': u'QtWebKit goes Mobile'}], 'title': u'QtWebKit goes Mobile', 'author': u'Kenneth Rohde Christiansen (noreply@blogger.com)', 'content': [{'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'application/xhtml+xml', 'value': u'<div><i>Repost of Jesus\' <a href="http://wouwlabs.com/blogs/jeez/?p=197">post</a>, that I helped write.</i><br /><p>There is a lot of effort being put into <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/QtWebKit" class="wiki">QtWebKit</a> in order to make it attractive on the mobile front.</p><p>Among a tons of bug fixes and good performance improvements there are also lots of new features being developed, mainly geared toward mobile deployment.</p><p>The goal with this tutorial is to help you understand some of these new features and how to make the best of them.

Entry title: QtWebKit goes Mobile
Entry link: http://codeposts.blogspot.com/2010/06/qtwebkit-goes-mobile.html
Entry description: <div><i>Repost of Jesus' <a href="http://wouwlabs.com/blogs/jeez/?p=197">post</a>, that I helped write.</i><br /><p>There is a lot of effort being put into <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/QtWebKit" class="wiki">QtWebKit</a> in order to make it attractive on the mobile front.</p><p>Among a tons of bug fixes and good performance improvements there are also lots of new features being developed, mainly geared toward mobile deployment.</p><p>The goal with this tutorial is to help you understand some of these new features and how to make the best of them. Or said in other words; how to create a good mobile web view that can be used on touch devices.</p><p>First we should make it clear that QGraphicsWebView is the way forward, so if you want to target mobile devices, it is bye bye QWebView. Why is that? Well, the QWebView is based on the QWidget system, thus it cannot easily support rotation, overlays, hardware accelerated compositing and tiling. If you need a QWidget anyway, you can always construct a QGraphicsView (which is a QWidget) with a QGraphicsWebView inside. This is more or less what we will start with.</p><p>Let's start with the most simple QGraphicsWebView based "browser" ever:</p><pre class="wiki">int main(int argc, char **argv)<br />{<br />   QApplication app(argc, argv);<br />   const int width = 640;<br />   const int height = 480;<br /><br />   QGraphicsScene scene;<br /><br />   QGraphicsView view(&amp;scene);<br />   view.setFrameShape(QFrame::NoFrame);<br />   view.setVerticalScrollBarPolicy(Qt::ScrollBarAlwaysOff);<br />   view.setHorizontalScrollBarPolicy(Qt::ScrollBarAlwaysOff);<br /><br />   QGraphicsWebView webview;<br />   webview.resize(width, height);<br />   webview.load(QUrl("http://www.wouwlabs.com/blogs/jeez"));<br /><br />   scene.addItem(&amp;webview);<br />   view.resize(width, height);<br />   view.show();<br /><br />   return app.exec();<br />}</pre><p>Here we just bootstrap a QGraphicsView application and add a QGraphicsWebView to the scene.</p><p>It might seem a bit useless as you can only navigate through one website, but it serves well as a simple example. Notice that I'm disabling the scrollbars on the graphics view because <a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/QtWebKit" class="wiki">QtWebKit</a> handles scrolling and scrollbars automatically. This is due to scrolling optimizations and due to the fact that web authors can interact with the scrollbars for instance style them differently.</p><p>On touch-based mobile devices a feature known as tiling is often used. It is used due to the interaction model (touch) as well as a scrolling "optimization". With this optimization we will have to deal with scrolling ourselves and we thus will have to say good bye to the scrollbar styling. Not a big thing, as mobile browsers usually do not even show scrollbars, but use scroll indicators instead.</p><p>Tiling basically means that the contents of the viewport is separated into a grid of tiles, so that when you update some area, instead of just updating the area you actually update the whole tile. This gives a few advantages for scrolling as when you scroll you do not need to repaint the new visible area for each scroll step, as you update a row of tiles each time; tiles that are often only partly on the screen. This minimized all the paint calls that we have to do and makes it possible to make nicely kinetic scrolling a possibility.</p><p>Loading, layouting etc are blocking operations. Though barely noticeable on a Desktop machines, these operations can block for a long time on a mobile device, letting the user believe the application has become unresponsive and died. Scrolling which is done by using fingers will also stall and give a bad user experience.</p><p>One way to over come this issue, is to do all loading, layouting and painting (basically all non-UI related work) in another thread or process, and just blit the result from the web process/thread to the UI. When using tiles, you can blit any tile available when scrolling. When no tile is available you can show a checkerboard tile instead, not letting the scrolling wait for the tiles to be updated. This results in a responsive interface, with the only disadvantage that you from time to time might see checkerboard tiles.</p><p>Tiles also helps with zooming. Repainting at each zoom level change during a zoom animation is basically impossible on a mobile device (or desktop for that sake) and thus with tiling, you can stop the tiles from being updates and just scale the already existing tiles, and then at the end of the animation update tiles on top of the scaled ones.</p><p>For now we will ignore the blocking issue and concentrate on the tiling and the interaction model.</p><p><br /></p><h3 id="Resizetocontents">Resize to contents<a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=36235783#Resizetocontents" class="anchor" title="Link to this section"></a></h3><p>When using tiling, we basically want the QGraphicsWebView to act as our contents, as it supports tiling a.o. things. In order for this we need to make it resize itself to the size of its contents. For this we will use <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qgraphicswebview.html#resizesToContents-prop" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"> </span>QGraphicsWebView::resizesToContents</a>.</p><p>From Qt 4.7 documentation: "If this property is set, the QGraphicsWebView will automatically change its size to match the size of the main frame contents. As a result the top level frame will never have scrollbars. It will also make CSS fixed positioning to behave like absolute positioning with elements positioned relative to the document instead of the viewport."</p><p>This setting, thus, removes the scrollbars for us on the main frame and makes our QGraphicsWebView resize itself to the size of its content.</p><p>Enabling it, is as easy as:</p><pre class="wiki">    webview.setResizesToContents(true); </pre><p>Qt 4.7 docs also says: "This property should be used in conjunction with the QWebPage::preferredContentsSize property. If not explicitly set, the preferredContentsSize is automatically set to a reasonable value."</p><p>If we are going to expand our mobile web view to the size of the contents of its contained page, then that is going to make the view a lot bigger that what can fit on the device's screen!</p><p><br /></p><h3 id="Usingaviewasthewindowtothecontents">Using a view as the window to the contents<a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=36235783#Usingaviewasthewindowtothecontents" class="anchor" title="Link to this section"></a></h3><p>The idea is to have a custom widget which has a QGraphicsWebView as a class member. Remember that the QGraphicsWebView will be as big as its content's size, so this custom widget will serve as a window, as a viewport.</p><p>There is not much more to say here, and the following code snippet illustrates it well:</p><pre class="wiki">class MobileWebView : public QGraphicsWidget<br />{<br />    Q_OBJECT<br /><br />public:<br />    MobileWebView(QGraphicsItem *parent = 0);<br />    ~MobileWebView();<br /><br />    bool mousePress(const QPoint &amp;value);<br />    void mouseMove(const QPoint &amp;value);<br />    void mouseRelease(const QPoint &amp;value);<br /><br />private:<br />    QGraphicsWebView *webView;<br />}; </pre><p>In order to properly handle mouse events you must install an event filter on web view or stack it behind its parent object (search for QGraphicsItem::ItemStacksBehindParent). By doing this the mouse events will reach a MobileWebView instance before they reach the member QGraphicsWebView.</p><p>Keep in mind that you'll need to add some logic in order to distinguish different mouse events and gestures like a single click, double click, click-and-pan, etc. That is left as an exercise to the reader.</p><p>Also keep in mind that as stated earlier, scrolling will have to be implemented manually, just as zoom etc.</p><p><br /></p><h3 id="Adjustinghowcontentsislaidout">Adjusting how contents is laid out<a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=36235783#Adjustinghowcontentsislaidout" class="anchor" title="Link to this section"></a></h3><p>When testing the above on a device, you will notice that many pages do not layout very nicely. In particular the width is larger than the width of the device!</p><p>The way web contents is laid out, is that the first the viewport width is used for fitting the contents. If the contents doesn't fit due to non-flexible element with a width larger than the viewport width, the min width possible will be used.

It also means your application can use a lot more efficient caching as files have to be loaded only once, and things can be kept in memory between requests. Of course the downside is that if your PHP script dies, then the whole server is down. But that is easy to deal with by a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming">defensive programming</a>.</p>
<p>At this point the Runtime is targeted at web developers interested in trying out Midgard, but eventually we'll be using the bundle system also for distributing full Midgard-powered web applications to the desktop. The progress on this can be followed <a href="http://github.com/midgardproject">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/Develop/Web/">Nokia's Web Runtime</a>, the Midgard Runtime should be more familiar to developers as you'll be able to write also server-side PHP code, not just JavaScript. In addition to PHP, the whole system is <a href="http://devel.akbkhome.com/seed/Midgard.html">also accessible</a> via any language that can handle <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection">GObject Introspection</a>.</p>
<h2>So, what can I do with it?</h2>
<ul><li>Install a Midgard environment with <em>$ midgard2-runtime-bundle-simple-install</em></li>
<li>Start the runtime with <em>$ midgard2-runtime-bundle-simple-run</em></li>
<li>Midgard MVC and components are located in <em>~/.midgard2/simple-bundle/</em>. This is where you can also place your own code</li>

It was all fairly brief which already led me to believe that knowledge of Django\u2019s inner works and basic setup and configuration was required to follow along.</p>\n<p>Well, the instructions are not as streamlined as other programming books I\u2019ve read and it could be fairly tricky to follow the examples and logic if you\u2019re not already familiar with how Django works. There are several typos in the example code as well, mostly due to missing spaces between the commands and arguments. Adding to the confusion is the style the author chose to deliver his explanation of specific code changes, displaying snippets of code that will leave the reader wondering what specific file is being discussed.</p>\n<p>Now, if none of these things sound scary to you, you\u2019ll be happy to know that the project itself is fairly well designed and worth your time. It was also the first time I saw an example of integrating Django with <strong>Google Checkout</strong> to set up a \u201cshopping cart\u201d mechanism, and by the time you\u2019re done with the second chapter, you will have a very basic but functional ecommerce web site.</p>\n<p>The subsequent chapters were a blur, talking about adding external modules and services to enhance your site\u2019s searching capabilities as well as exposing the data from your \u201cstore\u201d via APIs and generating reports with <strong>ReportLab</strong>. The author also talks about making use of javascript to add that <strong>AJAX</strong>-y feeling that we\u2019ve come to expect of most modern sites and how to take advantage of <strong>S3</strong> storage to sell your product.</p>\n<p>The last chapter finally walks you through a few different ways you can deploy your final project to the world out there. I thought it was interesting to see <strong>Fabric</strong> being mentioned as a driver for deployment, as I have been playing with it at work to help me perform a series of tests on several different hosts for QAing purposes. Come to think of it, this may have been the first time I\u2019ve seen it mentioned in a book, so I\u2019m glad that this project seems to be picking up steam.</p>\n<p>Overall, even with the issues of poor proof checking of the source code and the \u201ceverything and the kitchen sink\u201d approach to the first chapters, if you\u2019re not new to Django and need to get some ideas on how to design and develop an ecommerce website, you may want to check out this book.

At the very heart of Telepathy there is a <a href="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/spec/">specification</a> that describes how the various connection managers, clients and other components interact with each other. The specification is written in terms of a set of D-Bus APIs.</p>\n<p>Telepathy takes full advantage of what\u2019s provided by D-Bus, which is why you see so many different interfaces in the specification (one day I\u2019ll write more about this), but one thing it makes frequent use of is variant types and specifically string-&gt;variant maps (known in D-Bus parlance as a{sv} maps).</p>\n<p>a{sv} maps are used by the DBus.Properties.GetAll() method, to return all of the properties in an interface (which are all of different types), but in Telepathy they\u2019re used more generically with namespaced properties to make <a href="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/spec/Connection_Interface_Requests.html#org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection.Interface.Requests.CreateChannel">requests for communication channels</a> and <a href="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/spec/Account.html#org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Account.Parameters">collate information</a>. The types are specified by the key names.</p>\n<p>Telepathy-GLib exposes these maps as GHashTables of element type string-&gt;GValue, which actually works quite well in C. Telepathy-GLib <a href="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/doc/telepathy-glib/telepathy-glib-gtypes.html">registers specific GTypes</a> with GLib via DBus-GLib and we have generic utility functions to unpack the GValues into native C types. For simple types, this also works really well in the bindings. For simple types (int, string, boolean, etc.) GJS converts the GValue values in our map into native JS values and things are pretty neat. Unfortunately this does not work for complex, container types (e.g. sa{sv}as); GLib doesn\u2019t provide enough API to query the complete type information of the GValue\u2019s contents, thus it\u2019s not possible to introspect.</p>\n<p>The GLib solution to this problem is <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/stable/glib-GVariant.html">GVariant</a>, a way to store values that keeps all of the type information in an easily accessible way. If tp-glib exposed a{sv} maps as string-&gt;GVariant, we would easily be able to unpack the complete type in GJS or PyGI. GDBus uses GVariant for passing around types, but porting tp-glib to GDBus would take a lot of effort and radically break the API and ABI, so just isn\u2019t feasible at this stage.</p>\n<p>But there is a solution! Unsurprisingly, DBus-GLib has the information to recursively unpack a GValue registered with itself, it requires this in order to marshal those GValues into a D-Bus message, but it also exposes this API so we can use it for our own ends. Thus it becomes possible to convert these GValues to GVariants! In fact <a href="http://people.collabora.co.uk/~danni/files/gvalue-to-gvariant.c">here is some sample code</a> (Telepathy-GLib is not strictly required, it\u2019s only being used here to provide test cases). I\u2019m hoping this utility can be provided as part of DBus-GLib and then used to provide alternative API for tp-glib that can be exposed to the bindings.</p>\n<p>To complete the circle, I wrote <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622344">GVariant unpacking</a> for GJS, but it needs reworking to only unpack when explicitly requested instead of implicitly always.</p>\n<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28715">bug #28715</a> provides a proposed patch to dbus-glib.</p></div>', 'language': u'en'}], 'source': {'updated': u'2010-06-28T08:20:33Z', 'subtitle': u"Danielle's technical stuffs", 'updated_parsed': (2010, 6, 28, 8, 20, 33, 0, 179, 0), 'links': [{'href': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/danni/feed/', 'type': u'application/rss+xml', 'rel': u'self'}, {'href': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/danni', 'type': u'text/html', 'rel': u'alternate'}, {'href': u'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/au/', 'type': 'text/html', 'rel': u'license'}], 'title': u'scrambled tofu', 'subtitle_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u"Danielle's technical stuffs"}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'language': u'en', 'value': u'scrambled tofu'}, 'link': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/danni', 'id': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/danni'}, 'title_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'text/plain', 'value': u'introspecting tp-glib and converting DBus-GLib GValues to GVariants', 'language': u'en'}, 'link': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/danni/2010/06/23/introspecting-tp-glib-and-converting-dbus-glib-gvalues-to-gvariants/', 'author': u'Danielle', 'author_detail': {'name': u'Danielle'}, 'id': u'http://blogs.gnome.org/danni/?p=59'}

{'summary_detail': {'base': 'http://planet.gnome.org/atom.xml', 'type': 'application/xhtml+xml', 'value': u'<div><p>Today I was given a beating on identi.ca about no longer being a supporter of free software.</p>\n\n<p>Well, perhaps not. @fabsh, who I\'d have considered a friend, said "Although @sil used to be quite pro-Free Software", with the obvious implication that today, I am not.</p>\n\n<p>Today, on Twitter, a non-free web service where most of my friends hang out, I mentioned that my dad had been to see the Queen today; I asked for advice on where I should take my daughter on holiday and how I could find a decent website for that; I complained about Doubletwist deciding that it was the most important media player on my Android phone; and I mentioned that my house sale was going ahead. Now, all my twitter messages also appear on identica.</p>\n\n<p>On Twitter, I was offered a number of helpful suggestions about where to find cheap holidays; I was asked why my dad went to see the Queen; the Doubletwist forums people let me know that my annoyance was a bug which was about to be fixed, and I was asked a few questions about Shot of Jaq, a podcast I do with Jono Bacon.</p>\n\n<p>On Identica, I was given a bollocking because I don\'t believe in free software.</p>\n\n<p>A long time ago, Larry Wall gave a "State of the Onion" speech. Larry is the guy behind Perl, the programming language, and every year he gave a talk about what he believes Perl is all about and where it\'ll be going over the following twelve months. Larry\'s not really a programmer; he\'s a linguist who does a lot of programming. So his view on what a computer language should be is uniquely interesting, and should be read. Anyway, he spoke of freedom, and characterised the ends of the spectrum on the subject as "Bill" and "Richard", those two being Bill Gates (at the time head of Microsoft) and Richard Stallman (head of the Free Software Foundation): the idea here was that those two represented the ultimate expressions of their philosophies. Richard Stallman was at the far extreme of belief in free software; Bill Gates was at the other far end, decrying the very concept of freedom. It was a throwaway joke, at the time; a caricature for the purpose of a laugh in a presentation.</p>\n\n<p>Now, free software is a subject close to my heart. I work for Canonical, a company that builds an operating system composed of free software. Within that company, I work on Ubuntu One, a cloud service. We use CouchDB on your computer (free software) which replicates to CouchDB on our servers (free software); Tomboy, the note-taking software, on your computer (free software), which syncs using the Snowy API (an open API definition, defined by the very clever Tomboy team with a few suggestions from us) and saves its data in CouchDB (free software); bookmark syncing from Firefox using an extension named Bindwood (free software) to CouchDB (free software) on your machine; mobile contacts syncing through Funambol (free software) and storing the data in CouchDB (free software); and the Ubuntu One syncdaemon (free software) which syncs your files to our file sync server (closed source).</p>\n\n<p>In the identica thread mentioned above, I\'m characterised as someone who helps "Canonical produce proprietary net services".</p>\n\n<p>A long time ago (longer than the Larry Wall thing, above), there was the "one drop rule" in the United States. It basically classified you as "black" if you had any black ancestry at all. This was a rule back in the days when having "black blood" was somehow a bad thing. Fortunately, these days, it seems that such outdated and racist rules are no longer a part of the American psyche. Unfortunately, the principle seems to have been picked up by a subset of the free software movement: if your software has any part which is not available to the public, the whole suite is tainted. By working on it or with it or around it, you are not a supporter of free software. The smallest part of your software which is not available for scrutiny is enough to tarnish everything else you do, and quite possibly everything else you\'ve ever done, as beyond the pale: unacceptable to the audeience, because it\'s non-free. The parts that are free, even if they comprise the majority, are unrecognised.</p>\n\n<p>I\'m pretty sad about this. I\'d consider myself a supporter of free software. I evangelise Ubuntu, my chosen GNU/Linux distribution, to as wide an audience as I can manage; I help to build a software service which is composed of free software except for a couple of parts; I\'m half of a podcast which talks about Linux software twice a week. And yet I am vilified for being insufficiently dedicated to freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Jo Shields (@directhex), an immensely talented hacker and someone else I\'d consider a friend, who hacks on Banshee and has spent some time educating me about Mono, has been involved in an argument recently on reddit with someone who hates him because he likes Mono. That argument has incuded his opposer declaring that GPL-non-compatible licences cannot be free software. Again, I\'m pretty sad about this. The actual definition of freedom seems to have been lost. Instead, a developer has to prove their dedication.

Entry title: On annoyance and free software

Entry description: <div><p>Today I was given a beating on identi.ca about no longer being a supporter of free software.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps not. @fabsh, who I'd have considered a friend, said "Although @sil used to be quite pro-Free Software", with the obvious implication that today, I am not.</p>

<p>Today, on Twitter, a non-free web service where most of my friends hang out, I mentioned that my dad had been to see the Queen today; I asked for advice on where I should take my daughter on holiday and how I could find a decent website for that; I complained about Doubletwist deciding that it was the most important media player on my Android phone; and I mentioned that my house sale was going ahead. Now, all my twitter messages also appear on identica.</p>

<p>On Twitter, I was offered a number of helpful suggestions about where to find cheap holidays; I was asked why my dad went to see the Queen; the Doubletwist forums people let me know that my annoyance was a bug which was about to be fixed, and I was asked a few questions about Shot of Jaq, a podcast I do with Jono Bacon.</p>

<p>On Identica, I was given a bollocking because I don't believe in free software.</p>

<p>A long time ago, Larry Wall gave a "State of the Onion" speech. Larry is the guy behind Perl, the programming language, and every year he gave a talk about what he believes Perl is all about and where it'll be going over the following twelve months. Larry's not really a programmer; he's a linguist who does a lot of programming. So his view on what a computer language should be is uniquely interesting, and should be read. Anyway, he spoke of freedom, and characterised the ends of the spectrum on the subject as "Bill" and "Richard", those two being Bill Gates (at the time head of Microsoft) and Richard Stallman (head of the Free Software Foundation): the idea here was that those two represented the ultimate expressions of their philosophies. Richard Stallman was at the far extreme of belief in free software; Bill Gates was at the other far end, decrying the very concept of freedom. It was a throwaway joke, at the time; a caricature for the purpose of a laugh in a presentation.</p>

<p>Now, free software is a subject close to my heart. I work for Canonical, a company that builds an operating system composed of free software. Within that company, I work on Ubuntu One, a cloud service. We use CouchDB on your computer (free software) which replicates to CouchDB on our servers (free software); Tomboy, the note-taking software, on your computer (free software), which syncs using the Snowy API (an open API definition, defined by the very clever Tomboy team with a few suggestions from us) and saves its data in CouchDB (free software); bookmark syncing from Firefox using an extension named Bindwood (free software) to CouchDB (free software) on your machine; mobile contacts syncing through Funambol (free software) and storing the data in CouchDB (free software); and the Ubuntu One syncdaemon (free software) which syncs your files to our file sync server (closed source).</p>

<p>In the identica thread mentioned above, I'm characterised as someone who helps "Canonical produce proprietary net services".</p>

<p>A long time ago (longer than the Larry Wall thing, above), there was the "one drop rule" in the United States. It basically classified you as "black" if you had any black ancestry at all. This was a rule back in the days when having "black blood" was somehow a bad thing. Fortunately, these days, it seems that such outdated and racist rules are no longer a part of the American psyche.
