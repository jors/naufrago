If you currently have Naufrago! 0.1 installed, please, 
follow this steps BEFORE RUNNING THE APP in order to
upgrade to 0.2 version:

1. UNCOMPRESS 'naufrago-0.2.tar.bz2'. If you are reading
   this, you probably did it already.

2. COPY the following directories and files from Naufrago!
   version 0.1 to the root of the previously uncompressed
   directory:

   - favicons
   - imagenes
   - naufrago.db

3. RUN the script named 'update_0.1_to_0.2.py' provided
   within this tarball. You can do it through one of the
   following options (with the user which you usually run
   Naufrago!):

   OPTION 1:
   chmod +x update_0.1_to_0.2.py && ./update_0.1_to_0.2.py

   OPTION 2:
   python update_0.1_to_0.2.py

4. If there were no errors, you're done! Launch this new
   version of Naufrago! and enjoy!

 PROBLEMS
----------

Q. I ran the 0.2 app version before doing the upgrade
steps and now the app does not work well! Help!

A. If you run the 0.2 app version before doing previous upgrade
steps, please, delete the 'favicons' and 'imagenes' directories and
the 'naufrago.db' file and proceed with the steps.

Q. At step 3, when I run the script, it says it cannot find the
database file.

A. Make sure you copied the 0.1 database on the same path where
the script is. Also make sure you have write permission on it.

Q. I did not used 0.1 version, what should I do?

A. Just ignore this whole file and run the 0.2 app happily :)
